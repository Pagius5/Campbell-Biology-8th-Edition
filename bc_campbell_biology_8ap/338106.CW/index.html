<p>If scientists wore medals on their chests like military generals, ecologist Gene Likens would be one of biology's most decorated heroes. His recent awards include the 2001 National Medal of Science and the 2003 Blue Planet Prize, which honors "outstanding scientific research that helps solve environmental problems." Dr. Likens shared the latter award with his longtime collaborator, Herbert Bormann, with whom Likens pioneered the field of "long&ndash;term ecological research" at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. As President and Director of the Institute of Ecosystem Studies in upstate New York, Dr. Likens manages a large team of scientists and educators, but he returns to Hubbard Brook each summer to continue his inquiry about how forest and aquatic ecosystems work. We conducted this interview at one of Hubbard Brook's historic research sites.</p>

<p><b>How did the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest become the focus of your ecosystem research?</b></p>
<p>When I joined the Dartmouth faculty in 1961, I met Herb Bormann, who had this idea for a small&ndash;watershed approach for studying forest ecosystems. The Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest was ideal for such studies and was close by. And so it was one of those chance situations where it all just fell together. Much of my scientific career has been the result of such serendipity&mdash;that is, keeping your eyes, your ears, and your mind open, and when there's an opportunity, jump in and try to make something productive from it.</p>

<p><b>Why is Hubbard Brook so attractive as a field station for ecosystem research?</b></p>
<p>Our challenge from the beginning was to confront the complexity of this ecosystem and make sense of it. So, we started with the small&ndash;watershed approach. The idea was very simple: We used a medical analogy. We figured we could measure the chemistry of stream water, much like a physician would measure the chemistry of blood, to analyze the health of the watershed, the patient. We wanted to measure all the inputs to the system, such as in precipitation, and all the outputs such as in the stream water draining the system, and from that, try to understand the health of this patient. In each watershed, we find a place where the bedrock is close to the surface, and then build a gauging station, also called a weir. All the water coming down the hill is forced to pass through the weir, so we can measure the amount and chemical composition of the stream water very accurately year round.</p>

<p><b>This is your forty&ndash;second straight summer of such studies here at Hubbard Brook. It must be tough to get funding to support research over such a long term.</b></p>
<p>Our proposals for research grants mostly emphasize short&ndash;term questions that require long&ndash;term data. For example, long&ndash;term data from Hubbard Brook were critical in establishing that acid rain exists, and also provide the basis for shorter&ndash;term measurements of whether the problem of acid rain is getting worse or better. Long&ndash;term ecological research has become a hallmark of Hubbard Brook studies.</p>

<p><b>What was the public impact of evidence for acid rain in the Hubbard Brook Forest?</b></p>
<p>Although Swedish scientists studied acid rain earlier, our research was the first documentation of acid rain in North America. When we published our first paper on acid rain in 1972, the press really picked up on it. The evidence that there was something wrong with rain was a powerful issue that the public could relate to. The long&ndash;term data from Hubbard Brook made it very difficult to argue that there was no such thing as acid rain, and I think it's fair to say that the quality of those long&ndash;term data contributed to the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act that addressed the link between acid rain and combustion of fossil fuels.</p>

<p><b>Hubbard Brook is also famous for experiments on the effects of deforestation. How do you do such large&ndash;scale experiments, and what were some key results?</b></p>
<p>An example of these experimental manipulations is when we cut down all the trees in one of the watersheds and left them where they fell. We then used herbicides to prevent regrowth for three years. We compared the inputs and outputs for this experimental watershed with a reference watershed that was not altered. We expected more water to run off the experimental watershed, and that turned out to be the case. What we didn't expect was that the chemistry of the runoff would change so dramatically. For example, nitrate levels in the water shot up to a level that exceeded public health standards for drinking. Cutting the trees totally disrupted the recycling of nitrogen in the soil, and the nitrate that accumulated moved downstream. The nitrogen loss slowed after the second year, but some soil nutrients, such as calcium, still haven't come back to the levels and patterns that existed before the trees were cut in 1965.</p>

<p><b>How do these tree&ndash;cutting experiments relate to issues of forest management?</b></p>
<p>The research is fundamentally important to our basic understanding of how an ecosystem like this works, but the popular press picked up the story in terms of the clear&ndash;cutting controversy. Based on our long&ndash;term data, we proposed in a 1978 Science article that you can do clear&ndash;cutting in these kinds of forests if you follow specific guidelines. Clear cutting shouldn't be done on really steep slopes or in very large blocks, and certainly the stream channel should be protected. But most importantly, a site should not be clear cut very often. If a forest is harvested too frequently, then the system will become depleted of critical nutrients. It's just like a garden; if you continue to take away and never put anything back, you're going to deplete the soil. The Forest Service has now adopted a 100&ndash;year rotation policy (a particular section of forest can be logged only once every 100 years), and we're very proud of that. That forest management protocol is based on science.</p>

<p><b>Which current research projects at Hubbard Brook do you think are most likely to capture the attention of both the ecology community and the general public?</b></p>
<p>Richard Holmes at Dartmouth College and his colleagues are conducting really elegant long&ndash;term studies of bird populations. I think one of their newsworthy findings is that the total number of birds of all species present in the forest is currently about a third of what it was in 1969. Some species have actually increased in abundance, while others have almost disappeared from here. The researchers are now focusing on how predation, food availability, and other factors may be affecting the bird populations. Another project that I think is quite newsworthy involves a beautiful little lake at the bottom of this valley called Mirror Lake. One of the things I started at the very beginning of my work here, about 1965, was to record the period of ice cover on the lake. The ice cover is related to the total heat budget for the lake, so it's an indication of temperature and climate change. Well, as you might expect, the period of ice cover is highly variable over the short term because the weather varies from year to year. But our long&ndash;term data show that there is a highly statistically significant decline in the period of ice cover&mdash;about 19 fewer days of ice cover on the lake now than in the 1960s. This is a clear indication of global warming.</p>

<p><b>Along with your work at Hubbard Brook, you are President and Director of the Institute of Ecosystem Studies (IES). What motivated you 20 years ago to trade a prestigious endowed chair at Cornell for the challenge of leading a not&ndash;for&ndash;profit research and education institute?</b></p>
<p>I was asked that question many times by my colleagues, and some thought I was crazy. The job description for the IES position basically said that I could do anything I wanted as long as I did it well. And I liked that a lot. I was the founding director of IES, and I'm extremely proud of how the Institute has built such an outstanding international reputation. We have a superb scientific staff, often working together on projects ranging from a study of invasive zebra mussels in the Hudson River to research on the ecology of infectious diseases, including Lyme disease.</p>

<p><b>What do you find so attractive about the multidisciplinary, team&ndash;oriented research you direct at IES?</b></p>
<p>Many brains can often make faster and better advances than a single brain. The only way you can do big projects in science today is with teams, particularly in fields that emphasize bio&ndash;complexity. But such collaborative science requires trust in your colleagues. I think we should offer more training to graduate students to prepare them for working with research teams.</p>

<p><b>Speaking of training, IES complements its scientific mission with education programs. Are there any opportunities there for undergrads?</b></p>
<p>We have an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program. Each summer, about 10 to 12 REU students are selected. In addition to participating in research, the REUs receive instruction on writing scientific papers, finding jobs, and scientific ethics. Two of the students this year are doing research here at Hubbard Brook, and the rest of the group will come for a visit next week.</p>

<p><b>What was it about your own education, formal or otherwise, that made you so interested in nature?</b></p>
<p>I grew up on a small farm in Indiana, and my early childhood was spent barefoot, out in the forests and particularly around lakes. When I went to college, I was planning to become an elementary school teacher and a baseball coach. But I had a professor who just kept insisting that I go to graduate school. So to get him off my back, I applied to graduate schools and went to the University of Wisconsin, where I studied lake systems. It was another wonderful serendipitous event for me.</p>

<p><b>How have your 42 years of experience here at Hubbard Brook affected your view of nature?</b></p>
<p>Hubbard Brook has provided me with just wonderful questions to explore. I've gone from being a naive farm kid to using very sophisticated techniques to answer questions about this complex system and trying to help people understand why it's important to protect this kind of complexity in natural ecosystems. You must respect nature because it provides the basic life support system: clean air, clean water, clean soil, and nourishing food. And if you give these ecosystems a chance, they're resilient and will continue to provide the life support we need. Learning that here at Hubbard Brook changed my life. And can you believe someone pays me to work in such a beautiful place?</p>
