<p>The Hawaiian Islands are one of Earth's greatest natural laboratories for understanding mechanisms of evolution. Dr. Kenneth Kaneshiro has contributed much to that understanding through his research on the diverse species of Hawaiian <i>Drosophila</i> flies. Professor Kaneshiro is the director of the Hawaiian Evolutionary Biology Program at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, where he is also the director of the Center for Conservation Research and Training. I first met Dr. Kaneshiro in 2003, when I was a visiting scholar at Iolani School in Honolulu, where Kaneshiro began his education. It was a joy returning to Hawaii a year later to conduct this interview. I love this job!</p>

<p><b>How did the Hawaiian Islands form?</b></p>
<p>Geologically, the islands are very young, with the oldest island, Kauai, being only about 5 to 6 million years old. The islands popped up in chronological fashion as the Pacific Plate moved north&ndash; west over a volcanic hotspot on the seafloor. The youngest island, the Big Island of Hawaii, is over the hotspot now, and there is a new island, Loihi, beginning to form as an undersea mountain to the southeast of the Big Island.</p>

<p><b>And what makes the Hawaiian Islands such a compelling place to study evolution?</b></p>
<p>First, they're the most isolated landmass in the world, sitting out in the middle of the Pacific nearly 2,000 miles away from continents in any direction. So for any species of organism that arrived here&mdash;by blowing across the ocean on the wind, for example&mdash;the founding population would have then been isolated from gene flow from other populations of that species.</p>
<p>And some of the organisms that made it here radiated profusely into new species by colonizing other islands. Since the islands formed in single file, from Kauai to the Big Island, you also have a chronological sequence in the origin of species as founders went from older islands to newer ones. In the case of Drosophila, the evidence points to a single founder (a fertilized female) that arrived several million years ago and whose progeny eventually radiated into the more than 500 described species of Hawaiian Drosophila flies. That's about a quarter of all known Drosophila species in the world.</p>

<p><b>Obviously, that's far more Drosophila species than there are islands. Did environmental variation on each island contribute to that radiation of species?</b></p>
<p>Yes, differences in elevation, rainfall, and other factors make each island very environmentally diverse. And each island also has what are called kipukas, "islands" of vegetation surrounded by lava. So, there are islands within islands, with the lava forming barriers between the kipukas. For example, we have studied two kipukas on the Big Island that used to be connected before a lava flow separated them just 100 years ago. And we're already detecting significant genetic differences between Drosophila populations that live in these two kipukas. They're still the same species, but they've started to diverge. Speciation is still a very dynamic process on the Hawaiian Islands.</p>

<p><b>How did your interest in biology develop?</b></p>
<p>It probably started when I was a child growing up here in Hawaii. When my dad took us fishing around Oahu, it was very scientific, though it didn't seem that way to me at the time. My dad considered the tides and wind, and he matched the colors of his fishing lures to the kinds of baitfish that might be out there. When I fish today, I still apply those lessons from my dad. I think it was that sort of scientific approach to fishing that first got me interested in biology.</p>

<p><b>When did that interest turn to evolutionary biology?</b></p>
<p>When I was a freshman here at the University of Hawaii, I wanted to go into marine biology. But because of family pressures, I enrolled in the pre&ndash;med program instead. To help pay my way, I took a job with The Hawaiian Drosophila Project, starting as a dishwasher in the lab and learning how to prepare the nutrient media for breeding the flies. Within a few months, I was involved in actual research, dissecting genitalia and looking at other morphological characters that give us clues about the evolutionary history of the Hawaiian Drosophila species. I also had the opportunity to go into the field. So ecology also became part of my undergraduate education, not so much from the classroom, but by being involved in the Drosophila research. Every summer, 10 or 12 top scientists with different research specialties would visit to work on various Drosophila projects. Looking over the shoulders of these eminent scientists when I was an undergraduate really got me hooked. After I graduated, I switched to entomology for my graduate work so I could continue studying the Hawaiian Drosophila.</p>

<p><b>And that work included your research on mating behavior in Drosophila. I think many students will be surprised to learn that these flies court their mates.</b></p>
<p>The courtship between males and females is very elaborate. And the mating behavior also includes competition between males. A male will defend a territory to which females are attracted for mating. In one Drosophila species, for example, the males have very wide heads, and two males will butt their heads together&mdash;like rams&mdash;and then push each other back and forth as they joust for territory. In another species, the competition is more like sumo wrestling; the males get up "tippy&ndash;toe" on their hind legs, grappling with their middle and forelegs, and lock heads. But being a good fighter doesn't mean that you're also a good lover. For a male fly, being able to fight off other males and defend a territory gives him the most opportunity to encounter females, but he still has to be able to perform the very complex behavior that satisfies the courtship requirements of a female.</p>

<p><b>Such as?</b></p>
<p>In one species, the male hoists his abdomen up and over his head, in a scorpion&ndash;like pose. This displays to the female a row of specialized bristles that are on the underside of the abdomen. Each bristle is flattened like a fan. Then the male vibrates his abdomen, and the bristles waft a sex&ndash;attractant vapor called a pheromone secreted from an abdominal gland. At the same time, the male spreads his wings and rocks back and forth, emitting a sound. While dancing and singing, the male extends his mouthparts from a very white face. In response, the female actually kisses the male. Mating only occurs if the male can perform this elaborate display.</p>

<p><b>According to a model now known as the "Kaneshiro Hypothesis," changes in such mating behavior played a key role in the origin of Hawaiian Drosophila species, especially in the early stages of speciation. What's the basic idea?</b></p>
<p>Shifts in mating behavior can occur in a small population after a founding event. Say you have a population of flies on Kauai, the oldest island. Then Oahu pops up, and a fertilized female happens to make it there. She may found a new population on Oahu by producing a few hundred offspring. The males will vary in their ability to perform the species' original courtship rituals. But in such a small population, females who are very choosy will have less opportunity to reproduce than less choosy females, who will encounter more mates they are willing to accept. So selection favors fresh combinations of genes that combine adaptations to the new environment along with less rigid mating behavior than in the "parent" species back on Kauai. That would explain why mating behavior is typically the most complex in the oldest Drosophila	species. I think such shifts in mating behavior have been very important in the evolution of the Hawaiian Drosophila, and probably in many other groups of organisms as well.</p>

<p><b>At the same time that biologists are studying the evolution of such a diversity of species on the Hawaiian islands, the islands have been designated a biodiversity hotspot, meaning that many species are endangered. What are the biggest threats to biodiversity in Hawaii?</b></p>
<p>There is the destruction of habitat, but the impact of invasive species&mdash;nonnative species that are accidentally or purposefully brought to the islands&mdash;is probably the biggest threat. And ants may be the number one problem. Hawaii doesn't have any native ants; they're all alien. Their foraging in native forest ecosystems has severely impacted the native arthropod fauna. Invasive rats threaten the native birds by getting into nests and eating the eggs and young. Wild pigs are also a serious problem. They descended from hybridization between pigs the native Hawaiians brought to the islands and the pigs brought by Europeans. The wild pigs root in the forests, which creates puddles in which mosquitoes breed. The mosquitoes carry pathogens that cause malaria in birds. Also, invasive plants are crowding out many of the native plant species. Unfortunately, in spite of its small size, Hawaii is the extinction capital of the United States, if not the world.</p>

<p><b>One of your many hats is your role as director of the Center for Conservation Research and Training here at the University of Hawaii. What kind of work does the Center conduct?</b></p>
<p>Our research interest in conservation biology mainly takes an ecosystem and ecoregional approach: What happens on the mountaintops affects ecosystems all the way down to the coral reefs and beyond. I think we have to understand such relationships between ecosystems in order to protect the islands' biodiversity. The Center also has a major commitment to education. We have a National Science Foundation grant that supports outreach programs where our graduate students work with schoolchildren and mentor their teachers. We get these K&ndash;12 students out into the field participating in research: They are collecting valid scientific data, discovering new species, and helping us understand how to eradicate some of the alien species. The sheer numbers of these young scientists enable us to make certain kinds of measurements that would be impossible otherwise. For example, researchers would usually monitor contaminants in a stream by collecting water samples at a few points along the stream. But our graduate students worked with 320 seventh graders to sample the water all the way from a mountain waterfall to where the stream drains into the ocean. To me, this kind of environmental education, beginning at a young age, will eventually increase public awareness and make us all more effective in protecting our water resources and our native ecosystems.</p>
