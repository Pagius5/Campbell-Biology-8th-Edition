<p>Erich Jarvis is an assistant professor at the Duke University Medical Center, where he teaches neuroscience and studies the brain, using vocal communication by zebra finches and other songbirds as his main model system. Growing up in New York City, he attended the High School of the Performing Arts, where he showed great promise as a dancer. However, he chose to go another route, completing a double major in biology and mathematics at Hunter College and then a Ph.D. in molecular neurobiology and animal behavior at Rockefeller University. Dr. Jarvis has won numerous awards, including the National Science Foundation's highest honor for young researchers, the Alan T. Waterman Award. In addition to research and teaching, Dr. Jarvis has long been active in recruiting minority students to science.</p>

<p><b>What were your educational inspirations and challenges growing up?</b></p>
<p>Although my parents were separated and we were sometimes poor, I had a lot of support from both sides of my family, and my mother always encouraged me to aspire to something great. Most of my family were in the performing arts, and continuing in that tradition, I had the goal of becoming a dancer. I began with ballet and then went on to jazz and modern dance. But in my senior year of high school, I had a change of heart. I realized I wanted to have a bigger, positive impact in the world, and I thought I could do that best as a scientist. I was an okay student, but I didn't have a strong academic background. So when I got to college, I had to take remedial classes&mdash;I had a lot of catching up to do.</p>

<p><b>Do you see any connection between dance and science?</b></p>
<p>In terms of what's required for a successful career, I don't really see much of a difference. As a dancer, you need to have discipline. It's a very difficult field, there's a lot of competition, and you have to practice and practice. As a scientist, you also need discipline, and you have to deal with competition. There are actually more opportunities in science, although science is very difficult. Nature doesn't give up its secrets without a struggle!</p>
<p>On top of that, both fields require creativity. As a performing artist, you want to do something new and beautiful. It's the same for science: You're trying to do something new and creative. Also, in both fields, you have to adapt your schedule to what is required. There's so much overlap between being an artist and being a scientist that I'm amazed people don't see it more.</p>

<p><b>Why did biology appeal to you?</b></p>
<p>I think it had something to do with my cultural background. Like many of us in this country, I have a mixed ancestry&mdash;mine is African, Native American, and European. There was something about the cultural atmosphere in my family that seems especially connected to earthly things, nature, and so forth. Perhaps for that reason, I felt more at home in biology than in chemistry or physics, though I liked those subjects too.</p>

<p><b>Did you get to do research as an undergraduate?</b></p>
<p>At Hunter College, I benefited from several programs that promoted minority access to careers in scientific research. For four years, I worked in the laboratory of Professor Rivka Rudner, who was studying bacterial genes for ribosomal RNA. It took me almost a year to start to understand things, but then the excitement of laboratory research overcame me like a passion. Dr. Rudner would have to throw me out of the laboratory sometimes and tell me to go home and sleep. But soon after graduation, I published six papers.</p>

<p><b>What led you to neuroscience?</b></p>
<p>I was fascinated by the human brain. I wanted to know how the brain generates behavior, how it perceives it, and how it learns it. Of course, I realized that neurobiologists mostly have to work with nonhuman animals. When I got to graduate school, I started reading lots of papers, and I was disappointed to learn how little was known about the behavior of most common model organisms, such as the rat. At the time, neuroscience consisted of anatomy, neurophysiology (the study of nerve impulses and so forth), and an increasing amount of molecular biology&mdash;but very little behavior. But then I learned about Fernando Nottebohm's exciting research with songbirds, and I joined his laboratory.</p>
<p>The wonderful thing about the songbird system was that, when I began, there were already 40 years of research on the ecology and natural behavior of these animals. This research was like a box full of ideas for studying the brain mechanisms of songbird behavior, in particular their imitation of sounds. Very few animals have the ability to imitate what they hear&mdash;only songbirds, parrots, hummingbirds, bats, dolphins, and humans. Usually the animal imitates sounds of its own species, though some species can imitate other species and even mechanical sounds like a car. Fernando Nottebohm had identified nearly the complete brain pathway responsible for a songbird's production of a learned sound. I wanted to combine my molecular biology training with Dr. Nottebohm's discoveries and his knowledge of behavior. Already, an assistant professor in the laboratory, David Clayton, was using molecular biology. I was fascinated by the idea of figuring out the molecular genetics of imitative behavior in songbirds.</p>

<p><b>How might genes be connected to this sort of behavior?</b></p>
<p>After years of work on this question, I have now come to believe that what makes a vocal learner are genes that control the construction of brain circuits that connect to vocal muscles. And in addition to studying how genes regulate behavior, we're also studying how behavior regulates genes! The act of producing the learned sounds causes huge, short&ndash;term changes in gene expression in certain brain areas. Many of the genes involved encode transcription factors, which regulate the expression of a variety of other genes. When a songbird is singing, we see up to a 60&ndash;fold change in the amount of specific mRNAs and proteins in these brain areas.</p>
<p>We think this is happening for most behaviors in most animals, although we don't yet know the full circuits in other cases&mdash;in the case of walking, for example. But in songbirds, we can study every single group of neurons involved in the singing pathway and how their genes are regulated.</p>
<p>So now we're trying to find out the relationships between the rapid changes in gene expression in the brain as a result of the singing behavior, the electrical impulses that are going through the neural circuits to regulate both these genes and the behavior, and the behavior itself. To do this, we have to measure the mRNA and protein synthesis of certain brain cells and record electrical impulses from those same cells, both during the behavior.</p>

<p><b>How do you do these things?</b></p>
<p>To detect the electrical impulses, we implant hair&ndash;thin microelectrodes in different brain areas of a songbird, usually a zebra finch. The wires are connected to what's called a commutator, a mechanism originally used in helicopters. It allows the bird to fly around in the cage without getting tangled in the wires. The bird can sing and communicate with other birds while we record the electrical impulses.</p>
<p>To find out which genes are expressed in the nerve cells that are firing, we use DNA microarrays. For this part of our work, we are sequencing the "transcriptome" of the zebra finch brain&mdash;the DNA corresponding to all the different mRNAs made in brain tissue. We want to be able to put all the genes expressed in the songbird brain on microarrays. Then we'll be able to identify which genes are involved in any given behavior.</p>

<p><b>You have also studied birds in the wild. Why?</b></p>
<p>I wanted to see if the singing&ndash;driven gene expression we find in the lab occurs in the real world. So my colleague Claudio Mello and I visited songbird sites in a station wagon loaded with lab equipment and dry ice. To attract wild birds, we played recorded songs, causing males in the vicinity to sing like crazy. After about half an hour, when the products of gene expression in the brain should have accumulated, we captured the birds with a net. Then we took the brains back to the laboratory, and we did find robust singing&ndash;driven gene expression in those brains. But, more exciting, we also found phenomena that we hadn't seen in the lab: Some brain regions showed different patterns of gene expression that, I later discovered, depended on the social context in which the birds had been singing&mdash;to another male, to a female, or something else. And there turns out to be evidence for context&ndash;dependent patterns of activity in comparable brain areas in other animals, such as monkeys. We think there's a context&ndash;dependent brain pathway that is used for learned vocalization, speech, and other learned cognitive behaviors.</p>

<p><b>You're combining many approaches in your work!</b></p>
<p>Yes, and in addition to molecular biology, anatomy, electrophysiology, and behavior, we're making a lot of use of bioinformatics, which involves math and computer science. Biologists routinely use the computer to analyze gene expression data from DNA microarrays, but we also include in our computer analyses information about anatomical connectivity, behavioral data from song sonograms, and patterns of neural impulses. Our inference algorithm software helps us identify causal relationships and even proposes models we can test experimentally.</p>
<p>We are trying to look at what we study as an integrated system, not just a pattern of regulated genes or a combination of neural circuits. This is the way I approach science: If I'm going to study how something works, I've got to look at all aspects of it. I really encourage people to look at the big picture. That's probably the only way to reach the ultimate goal of understanding how the brain generates speech and language.</p>

<p><b>Are there potential medical benefits from this research?</b></p>
<p>One of our projects relates to Parkinson's disease, which is caused by a degeneration of neurons in certain parts of the brain. We're studying birds with similar defects. The songbird brain area that functions differently in different social contexts is the same area affected by Parkinson's disease in humans, and we see some similarities in vocal behavior associated with this area. For example, people with Parkinson's disease often stutter, and when damage occurs to this area of the bird brain, the affected bird sometimes does too. So we think we might be able to use these birds to study speech disorders.</p>

<p><b>What is your advice to students interested in biology?</b></p>
<p>It's important for students, especially those coming from a disadvantaged background, to know that biological research can be a very rewarding career, if you have a passion for it. Like an artist, you have to find your work intrinsically interesting. Figuring out how nature works is not an easy job; there are many frustrations. But intellectually, it can be one of the most rewarding and empowering of career choices.</p>
