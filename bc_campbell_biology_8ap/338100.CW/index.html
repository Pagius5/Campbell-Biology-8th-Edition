<script type="text/javascript">campbellInterview('Peter Agre')</script>

<p>In 2003 Peter Agre received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of aquaporins, "water pore" proteins that allow water molecules to rapidly cross the cell membrane. (He shared the prize with Roderick MacKinnon of Rockefeller University, who works on the other main aspect of cellular "plumbing"&mdash;the transport of ions.) A medical doctor as well as a researcher in basic science, Dr. Agre is a professor in the Departments of Biological Chemistry and Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.</p>

<p><b>How did you start in science?</b></p>
<p>As a little kid, really. I grew up in Northfield, Minnesota, where my dad was teaching chemistry at St. Olaf College. The kids in our family had an idyllic life, playing in apple orchards and roaming the campus. We lived right across the street from my dad's laboratory, a really nice lab with cheerful students who did summer research. I'd do little experiments with my father's help. We'd change the pH of some solution, and the indicator dye would turn pink or blue&mdash;it was amazing! As an adolescent I didn't want anything to do with any of that. But the first merit badge I ever earned as a Boy Scout was in chemistry. Then I became more interested in medicine.</p>

<p><b>What was the appeal of medicine?</b></p>
<p>In part, the people. The local doctors were really interesting and nice people, and it seemed like they did a lot of good things.</p>
<p>High school was a bit of a detour&mdash;I was kind of a hellraiser then. My friends and I started an underground newspaper (this was 1967, and I thought a revolution was about to occur). I didn't do a lot of school work. So I was invited to leave high school. I went to night school and then got into Augsberg College.</p>

<p><b>What turned you on to research?</b></p>
<p>At medical school, I spent time in a research lab, and that really fired me up. I got to work with a group of vibrant scientists from all over the world. I learned you could approach complex problems at a molecular level&mdash;reductionist biology. We purified a variant of cholera toxin produced by certain strains of the bacterium <i>E. coli</i>. Like the toxin of the true cholera bacterium (Vibrio cholerae), this can cause a terrible and sometimes fatal diarrhea.</p>
<p>If young people saw scientists the way I did in that lab, they would all want to be scientists. Too many people still stereotype scientists in a negative way&mdash;something like Doc from <i>Back to the Future</i>. I'm afraid we've lost good role models in science. And too often we scientists are so stressed out trying to get grants funded that our work doesn't look appealing to students.</p>
<p>People need to realize how much science is a social endeavor. Scientists have personalities and interests and fears and limitations. We're not cybertronic machines. And we collaborate. Unless you're at the level of Leonardo da Vinci, you get a lot of ideas from other people.</p>

<p><b>Tell us about combining medical practice with basic research.</b></p>
<p>Until 1993, I was an attending physician in Hematology here. I stopped in part because I was busy with starting a new graduate program in cellular and molecular medicine. (It provides Ph.D. training in basic science but with direct medical relevance.) Combining medical practice with basic research is a challenge because there are only so many hours in the day. I'm married with four children, and, as much as I liked my patients, my heart was more in the research. In practicing medicine, you can help individual patients, but with research, you might make a discovery that would help thousands of patients. As a student, I doubted I had what it took to succeed in basic science, but I wanted to try it.</p>
<p>I still have my medical license, which I use for Boy Scout camp physicals, ringside positions as medical doctor to amateur wrestlers, and inner city kids&mdash;I'm their doc. Anyway, my wife's not convinced that research is going to carry me to retirement. She may be right. I think it's better in life not to be overconfident.</p>

<p><b>Let's talk about the research that led to the discovery of aquaporins.</b></p>
<p>I'm a blood specialist (hematologist), and my particular interest has been proteins found in the plasma membrane of red blood cells. The plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer with inserted cholesterol molecules, "integral" proteins that span the bilayer, and membrane&ndash;associated proteins that bind to the membrane's inner surface. With red cells, it's easy to study plasma membrane in pure form, and there are interesting disorders associated with defects in the proteins.</p>
<p>When I joined the faculty at Hopkins, I began to study the Rh blood antigens. Blood group antigens are membrane glycoproteins of red cells that exist in the population in two or more forms. The differences can be in the attached carbohydrate, as with the antigens of the ABO blood groups, or they can be within the core protein. Rh is of medical importance because of Rh incompatibility, which occurs when Rh negative mothers have Rh positive babies and become sensitized to the Rh antigen. Unless the mother is treated, there's a significant risk that in subsequent pregnancies, her immune system will attack the baby's red blood cells. Surprisingly, as of the late 1980s, no one had yet been able to isolate the Rh antigen.</p>
<p>Membrane&ndash;spanning proteins like the Rh protein are really messy to work with. But we worked out a method to isolate and partially purify the Rh protein. Our sample seemed to consist of two proteins, but we were sure that the smaller one was just a breakdown product of the larger one. We were completely wrong, though: It was a water channel protein, which we later named aquaporin&ndash;1.</p>

<p><b>How did you figure that out?</b></p>
<p>It took a lot of convincing to make myself believe that this protein was even a new discovery. Using antibodies we made to the protein, we showed it to be one of the most abundant proteins in red cell membranes (200,000 copies per cell!) and even more abundant in certain renal (kidney) cells. I talked to 15 or so membrane biochemists: What could it be? Although many people study red cells, no one had ever seen this protein before because it doesn't stain with the usual protein stains. It was John Parker, a hematologist and superb red&ndash;cell physiologist, who finally said, "Maybe this protein is involved in water transport."</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we performed a simple experiment using frog egg cells: We injected the cells with mRNA that the cells translated into aquaporin and found that we could turn the cells from being almost watertight (without aquaporin) into highly water&ndash;permeable (with aquaporin). The cells with aquaporin would swell and explode in distilled water as a result of osmosis: With aquaporins, the cell membrane became permeable to water but not to things dissolved in it (solutes), so water molecules crossed the membrane from the side with less solute (distilled water) to the side with more (the cell interior).</p>
<p>You know, as a scientist, you can benefit from being a bit like Huckleberry Finn. You should explore your fancy to some degree. If something interesting shows up, it's good to go for it.</p>

<p><b>Why do cells have water channel proteins?</b></p>
<p>Not all cells do. Before our discovery, however, many physiologists thought that diffusion through the phospholipid bilayer was enough for getting water into and out of all cells. Others said this couldn't be enough, especially for cells whose water permeability needs to be very high or regulated&mdash;for example, cells forming the tubules of the kidneys, which control the concentration of the urine. A number of researchers had made observations indicating that diffusion through the phospholipid bilayer wasn't everything. But there was a lot of skepticism until our experiment with frog eggs ended the controversy.</p>
<p>Water transport is very important in our bodies. For example, our kidneys must filter and reabsorb many liters of water every day. If we don't reabsorb that water, we die of dehydration. Aquaporins allow us to reabsorb enough water, without reabsorbing ions.</p>

<p><b>How do aquaporins work?</b></p>
<p>The structure of an aquaporin molecule helps explain how it functions. The protein looks like an hourglass spanning the membrane. The two halves are symmetrical with opposite orientations. An hourglass works equally well if it's right side up or upside down, and aquaporins work equally well for the uptake or release of water. The driving force is not some kind of a pump action, but simply osmosis. An aquaporin allows osmosis to occur extremely rapidly. Nothing larger than water molecules can fit through the channel. In addition, the passage of ions is prevented&mdash;even small ones like the hydronium ions (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>) formed by the combining of H<sup>+</sup> with H<sub>2</sub>O. They are repelled by positively charged amino acids at the narrowest part of the channel.</p>

<p><b>What happens when mutations disrupt aquaporin function?</b></p>
<p>Mutations in aquaporin genes can cause health problems. People whose kidney cells have defective aquaporin&ndash;2 molecules need to drink 20 liters of water a day to prevent dehydration. They can't concentrate their urine enough. Individuals who can't make aquaporin&ndash;1 generally do OK in modern life, but they get dehydrated much more easily than other people. In addition, some patients make too much aquaporin, causing them to retain too much fluid. Fluid retention in pregnant women is caused by the synthesis of too much aquaporin&ndash;2.</p>
<p>Knowledge of aquaporins may in the future contribute to the solution of medical problems. Specific aquaporins, such as those of the malaria parasite, might be useful targets for new drugs.</p>

<p><b>What has the study of aquaporins revealed about evolution?</b></p>
<p>Several hundred aquaporins are known so far. Plants have the most; rice has around 50, whereas mammals have only about 10. Apparently, aquaporins are even more important for plants than animals. The presence of aquaporins in almost all organisms and similarities among the molecules suggest that aquaporin arose very early in evolution.</p>

<p><b>What are your major goals now?</b></p>
<p>Of great importance to me right now is the success of the next generation of scientists. As a scientist, there are three things that count: original discoveries, the respect of your peers, and training future scientists&mdash;and the third is perhaps the most important in the long run. Almost everything we scientists do eventually gets revised. We usually pick up a story and carry it for a while until someone else takes it over. So the educating of young scientists is a big issue, as is scientific literacy for everyone.</p>
