<p>Genomics, the study of all the genes in an organism and how they function together, is a new field that is bringing about a revolution in biology. Having played a major role in the Human Genome Project, Eric Lander is a leader of this revolution. Dr. Lander is the founding director of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, which uses genomics to develop new tools and approaches to understanding and treating disease. The institute includes the former Whitehead Center for Genome Research, which played a leading role in the sequencing of the human genome.</p>

<p>A graduate of Princeton, Dr. Lander earned a doctorate in mathematics at Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes Scholar. He then taught managerial economics at Harvard Business School until turning full time to biology in 1990. Among his many honors have been a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship and election to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Dr. Lander is a professor at both MIT and Harvard, and he has taught MIT's core introductory biology course for a decade.</p>

<p><b>How did you get into genetics?</b></p>
<p>In high school, I took biology, but I loved math, and I was a math major in college. I went on to get my Ph.D. in mathematics but decided I didn't want to be a pure mathematician. One day, my brother suggested I might be interested in the coding theory of the brain and sent me some papers on mathematical neurobiology. I realized that, to understand them, I had to learn something about cellular neurobiology. This required me to study cell biology. Next came molecular biology, and finally, I really had to know genetics. So one thing led to another&mdash;and here I am still learning genetics!<p><b>What was the main purpose of the Human Genome Project?</b>
<p>The ultimate purpose of the Human Genome Project was to read out and make freely available the complete DNA sequence of the human being. This information is fundamental to our biology. It contains the parts list in terms of which all our biological structures and processes must eventually be described.</p>
<p>You can study the detailed properties of individual genes, as biologists did before the Human Genome Project and still do, or you can study how all the components of the system interact. Important discoveries are made at both levels, but there are some things you only see when you step back. Imagine looking at a pointillist painting. Up close, the dots are interesting, but when you step back you can see patterns that weren't evident at first. Until the Human Genome Project, it hadn't been possible to step back and get the big picture of the human genome.</p>
<p>Analysis of the genome is unveiling a comprehensive picture of how the genes are turned on and off in different tissues and at different times, so we can see how genes collaborate in modules or circuits. It's an ensemble picture that we've just never had before.</p>

<p><b>What were the main challenges of the Human Genome Project?</b></p>
<p>The biggest challenge was the necessity of a 10,000&ndash;fold improvement in our methods for mapping and sequencing DNA&mdash;the project was that much more ambitious than anything ever done before! In any realistic sense, the scientific community was crazy to propose it. But realism is much overrated. Once we recognized how important the sequence would be to thousands of scientists, we began to ask why, exactly, we couldn't do it. Then we took on the barriers one at a time. We set intermediate goals, both to obtain some information that would be immediately useful and to show ourselves that we	were on the right track. And one after another, we were able to reach our goals: first, genetic maps we could use to trace the inheritance of diseases, then physical maps of the chromosomal DNA, and, finally, the nucleotide&ndash;by&ndash;nucleotide sequence of the whole genome.</p>
<p>It was a great experience. Everybody involved in the Human Genome Project knew we were working on something that would still be fundamental to science a hundred years from now. We felt it would be important to our children because the medicine of 50 years from now will be based on this work. And it was the work of no one individual, no one center, no one country. Overall, the project involved several thousand people at 20 centers all over the world&mdash;in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, and China. It was science at its best, an international collaboration of people working together for something bigger than themselves.</p>
<p>To achieve our goals, we constantly had to invent new methodologies, and we had to figure out how to automate as much as possible. Then we had to figure out how to analyze the data. My own background in mathematics actually turned out to be useful.</p>

<p><b>The genome sequences are just long chains of A's, C's, T's, and G's. How do you know which sections are genes?</b></p>
<p>Knowing the three billion letters of the human genome is still a far cry from understanding what they say. It's not easy to identify the genes within a very long sequence. This is particularly so in humans and other multicellular eukaryotes, which generally have huge amounts of noncoding DNA and gene&ndash;coding sequences split up into small segments (exons) interrupted by stretches of noncoding DNA (introns). In searching for human genes, we're looking for small signals in a sea of noise.</p>
<p>Computer programs can do a passable job of picking out gene sequences, but only passable. The sequences you can look for include ATG, which starts the coding sequence of all genes, but ATG is so common in the genome that it's not much of a signal. You can also look for places where that start signal is followed by a fairly long stretch of nucleotides before one of the three&ndash;nucleotide stop signals appears, but that can easily occur by chance. So, using a computer to look for those kinds of signals alone does a pretty crummy job of identifying genes.</p>
<p>Happily, we have other tricks up our sleeves. One way to identify genes is to compare the genome to copies of messenger RNA molecules from cells. Another powerful approach is to compare the human sequence to those of related species. Because many genes are crucial to an organism's survival, they tend to be conserved (not change very much) during evolution. So if we look at the portions of the human genome that are very similar in other mammals, they tend to contain genes. The task of finding all the genes is a fascinating puzzle that involves computer scientists, evolutionary biologists, molecular biologists, and others.</p>

<p><b>How many human genes are there?</b></p>
<p>My best guess today is that there are 20,000&ndash; 25,000 protein&ndash;coding genes. One of the most surprising findings of the Human Genome Project was a gene count much lower than people had expected based on the total size of the human genome; not so many years ago, textbooks gave 100,000 as the likely number of human genes. When we got the rough draft of the sequence, we thought there might be as many as 40,000 genes, but we soon learned that many of these were actually pseudogenes, which are defective, nonfunctional copies of true genes. The gene count has been falling and falling. Of course, genes for functional RNA molecules, such as rRNA, that are not translated into protein are also present in the genome, but they don't add up to a lot of territory, probably only a few thousand genes&mdash;although we're not certain.</p>

<p><b>How close are we to understanding the human genome?</b></p>
<p>The extent of our ignorance became clear from comparing the human genome with the mouse genome. When we lined up the two, we found that about 5% of the human genome showed strong similarity to that of the mouse, indicating strong evolutionary conservation since the last common ancestor of mouse and human. Thus, the sequences in this DNA must be functionally very important. But only about a third of the 5% could be accounted for by known genes and regulatory sequences, leaving a lot more that evolution "cares about" than we can explain today.</p>
<p>That's what I love about genomics. We're learning that there are vast tracts of biology we have missed. It's as if we suddenly could look at the whole Earth and see that, golly, there are several continents we hadn't known about. Genomics is revealing huge territories for the next generation of young scientists to explore.</p>

<p><b>How is genomics affecting the study of evolution?</b></p>
<p>Evolutionary biology is being transformed by the availability of genomic data. Now we can sit down with the complete sequences of a number of organisms and begin to reconstruct their evolutionary relationships and histories in exquisite detail. We can see the forces at work in different lineages. For instance, we can see that in humans the most actively evolving genes are those involved in reproduction and the immune system. Scientists have long thought that genomes carried such information about evolution, but we're finally getting to see it laid out clearly. Evolution is, so to speak, an experimentalist that has been running experiments for three and a half billion years, since the origin of life on Earth. And, wonderfully, the genomes of today's organisms retain the lab notes of these experiments, so that we can go back and reconstruct the events that took place.</p>

<p><b>Let's talk about the application of genomics to medicine. What goes on at the Broad Institute?</b></p>
<p>The key challenge ahead is to understand the molecular basis of common human diseases such as diabetes, lung cancer, psychiatric diseases, and many others. Understanding molecular mechanisms is key to creating therapies. The sequence of the human genome has given us a great foundation for systematic understanding of disease&mdash;but it's just a start. We now need a full understanding of all the functional elements encoded in the human genome sequence and how they regulate genes; of all the common genetic variants in the human population and how they correlate with risk of disease; of the gene and protein expression patterns that reflect the activation of cellular pathways; and of all the genetic mutations that underlie cancers. In parallel, we need to develop ways to use this comprehensive picture to identify the right targets for drug development and other therapies.</p>
<p>The Broad Institute's mission is to help drive this next stage of biomedicine. The institute includes many kinds of scientists&mdash;biologists, chemists, physicians, mathematicians, and others&mdash;from across MIT and Harvard, including the Harvard hospitals. Together, we're developing new ways to generate biological information and new ways to apply it in medical studies. We also feel strongly about making all the data publicly available, so that anyone can use it to ask new questions.</p>
