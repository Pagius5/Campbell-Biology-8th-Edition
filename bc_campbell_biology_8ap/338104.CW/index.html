<p>From her early work as an invertebrate zoologist at the University of Leningrad to her research today as one of the most prominent American plant biologists, Natasha Raikhel has traveled very far, both geographically and scientifically. Dr. Raikhel is now the Distinguished Professor of Plant Cell Biology at the University of California, Riverside (UCR), where she is also the director of the Center for Plant Cell Biology. In 2003, the American Society for Cell Biology honored Professor Raikhel's achievements with the Women in Cell Biology Senior Career Recognition Award, and in 2004 she received the Stephen Hales Prize of the American Society of Plant Biologists; the award is given to a scientist who has served the science of plant biology in some noteworthy manner. One of Dr. Raikhel's current interests is making systems biology possible by building multidisciplinary research teams. Dr. Raikhel's service to the biology community and her generosity as a mentor to young researchers exemplify the collaborative spirit of the science culture.</p>

<p><b>How did you begin your science career in what was then the Soviet Union?</b></p>
<p>Actually, I didn't go directly into science. I was a musician and was supposed to become a professional pianist. But at some point, I realized that I could not be one of the best pianists, and I didn't like that limitation. I always liked nature, and I was able to study biology at the University of Leningrad. I met my husband when we were both zoology students in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), where we continued our work at the university through graduate school until we acquired faculty positions. And then we decided to leave the Soviet Union.</p>

<p><b>What were the circumstances of your emigration?</b></p>
<p>This was in the late '70s, and as Jews in the Soviet Union, our career opportunities in science were limited, but we were fortunate enough to be allowed to emigrate. After our first son was born in 1975, we wanted him to be exposed to greater opportunities, and that helped us finalize our decision to leave. It was difficult to emigrate from the Soviet Union during that period. But there was a joke at that time that the Carter administration in the United States had a grains&ndash;for&ndash;Jews exchange policy&mdash;the more wheat the U.S. sent to the Soviet Union, the more Jews were allowed out. So we were very lucky that we were able to get out of the Soviet Union at a time when many people would have loved to leave.</p>

<p><b>How did you find your first jobs here?</b></p>
<p>It was difficult for scientists emigrating from the Soviet Union to find academic jobs because of a lack of references. But again, we were lucky. The research institute (Institute of Cytology) where I worked had a keen interest in modern biology, and the professor in charge invited visiting professors to spend their sabbatical leaves doing research at the institute. A professor, Jerry Paulin, who came with his family from the University of Georgia, had his desk right next to mine in the lab. Our families became friends. At that time, it was very difficult for American visitors in the Soviet Union to get around because they were told, "You cannot go here, you cannot go there." So we helped the Paulins during their visit to Leningrad. Later, when we planned our immigration to the United States, Jerry Paulin was the one professor in the U.S. who knew us and our work as scientists, and he helped us find jobs at the University of Georgia. And so we started all over again as postdoctoral researchers when we came to this country.</p>

<p><b>In Leningrad, you worked on protozoans&mdash;ciliates. But in Georgia, you began your work with plants. What motivated that change?</b>
<p>My interest is at the basic cellular level, and so the switch of organisms was not too difficult. I realized very soon after arriving in the U.S. that it would be hard to get grants for research on free&ndash;living protozoans, which do not cause disease. At the time, plant research was really starting to take off in the U.S., and Georgia was one of the key places where plant biology was very modern. I sensed this and wanted to be part of that environment, and so I learned a lot about plants. I also began to reeducate myself to do molecular biology. Molecular approaches in plant biology were just beginning. I didn't have to catch up because I learned along with many people who were also just beginning in molecular biology. So, once again, I was lucky with good timing.</p>

<p><b>Speaking of good timing, why is this a good time to be in plant biology?</b></p>
<p>One reason is that we now know a lot about a research organism, the plant Arabidopsis. Its genome has been sequenced, and many of its proteins have been identified. Once you understand the functions of these proteins, how the proteins interact, and how pathways in the cells interact, then you can really start to answer questions about how cells function and how the whole plant works. Systems biology becomes possible, and I think this makes plant biology much more exciting.</p>

<p><b>What will it take to make plant systems biology work?</b></p>
<p>The essence of systems biology is to be able to model organisms&mdash;to be able to predict how various pathways in the organism interact and how a change in one pathway will affect the whole organism. This requires our approaches to be more quantitative and much more integrated. We need to infuse plant biology with disciplines such as informatics and engineering, but this is difficult because people are coming from different scientific cultures. Right now, many of us are retraining to understand fields such as bioinformatics, but it will be much better when such multidisciplinary experience becomes the normal environment for training biologists. It is very important that the new generation of plant biologists be very quantitative and comfortable with bioinformatics, and that they are good biologists too. It will take time to create this new generation of scientists. But many people are looking to the community of Arabidopsis researchers to make the systems approach work, because this community is exemplary in terms of openness and sharing among colleagues.</p>

<p><b>The number of protein&ndash;coding genes in Arabidopsis rivals that of humans and other complex animals. Did that discovery surprise you?</b></p>
<p>Not really. Because plants are immobile, they have to be very versatile in their ability to respond to environmental stresses. Plants have to be exquisite to survive because they can't run. This requires a lot of different kinds of proteins, including many that are unique to plants.</p>

<p><b>Are there important agricultural applications from all this work on Arabidopsis?</b>
<p>Yes, because Arabidopsis is such a convenient model organism for studying processes that are important in all plants, including crop plants. For example, resistance to cold and resistance to pathogens are two traits that are very useful in crop plants. But such traits are much easier to analyze in Arabidopsis. So, if we first identify certain genes and regulatory pathways that can help Arabidopsis resist environmental stress, we can then transfer some of that knowledge to improve crop plants.</p>

<p><b>What is the focus of your own lab's research?</b></p>
<p>For a long time, my lab group has worked on the trafficking of molecules through the cell's vesicles and vacuoles. And in the last few years, we've added another project, the synthesis of the cell wall in plants. Vacuoles and cell walls have unique plant&ndash;specific functions and are essential for plant life. I therefore am very interested in fully understanding these mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>In recent years, your influence has extended beyond your own lab to a leadership role in the international community of plant cell biologists. Why do you think this expanded role is important at this stage in your career?</b>
<p>Well, first of all, I want to make it clear that my research with my own lab group is still my number&ndash;one priority. But with time, you start to realize that you have experience that enables you to do more for the science community in your field. I got a lot from the community of plant biologists, and now I want to be constructive in giving back to the community. In fact, at a certain point in your career, you have an obligation to give more than you take. For example, I was not looking to become editor&ndash;in&ndash;chief of the journal <i>Plant Physiology</i>, but colleagues convinced me to take the job. This takes a lot of my time now, but the journal is evolving beautifully, which is very rewarding.</p>

<p><b>As another example of "giving something back," you participate in a program that provides summer research opportunities at UCR for community college students. Is it fun for you to have these students in your lab?</b></p>
<p>I love to be around these young people because they keep me young. At first, when these students join the lab, they are completely na&#239;ve about research and just don't know how to get started. But once you put a fire under them and get them excited, it's the most rewarding thing in the world. For example, this past summer, we had a student from San Bernardino Valley College, a community college nearby. He just loved his project, and he will be on a paper that we are writing. He will also be transferring to UCR, and he still works in my lab for many hours each week, even though he's taking lots of courses. This student now wants to become a plant researcher&mdash;he's a convert! And that gives me great satisfaction.</p>

<p><b>With two very busy scientists in the family, how do you and your husband balance the demands of your careers with the responsibilities and enjoyment of family life?</b></p>
<p>I want young people beginning in science to understand that they will not have to shy away from having a family and having children because of their work. The most wonderful things I have in my life are my two sons. Balancing career and family is not easy, but it's all possible because I have a great husband, and we make decisions and do things together. You can't say, "You stay at home, and that's how we will share." Maybe that does work for some people, but in our case, we both wanted careers in science.</p>

<p><b>What other advice do you have for students who are interested in becoming scientists?</b></p>
<p>Because of the way biology is changing, I think students should look for programs that offer interdisciplinary approaches. They should not lock themselves into certain subfields. And they should reach for the stars. You have to be ambitious and work hard, and you have to know what you want, and then don't let anything stop you. You can grow as a scientist here like nowhere else in the world. I think I'm a living example of that. It's a fantastic life!</p>
