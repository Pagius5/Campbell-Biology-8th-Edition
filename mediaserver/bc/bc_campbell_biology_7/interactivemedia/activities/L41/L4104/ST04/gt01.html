Food contains small amounts of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('nucleicacids.html');return false;">nucleic acids</a>&#8212; DNA and RNA&#8212; which have to be digested to be absorbed and used by the body. Nucleic acid digestion begins in the small intestine, and is initiated by pancreatic <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('enzymes.html');return false;">enzymes</a>.
