Energy is the capacity to cause change. <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('kineticenergy.html');return false;">Kinetic energy</a> is the energy associated with motion. Energy that is not kinetic is called <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('potentialenergy.html');return false;">potential energy</a>, and is energy that matter possesses because of its location or structure. Energy is neither created nor destroyed but converted from one form to another. This property is called the conservation of energy. Click on the archer's arm to see a demonstration of the conservation of energy.
