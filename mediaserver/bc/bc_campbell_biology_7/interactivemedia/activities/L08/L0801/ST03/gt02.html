The stored <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('chemicalenergy.html');return false;">chemical energy</a> in food is released in your muscle cells during the process of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cellularrespiration.html');return false;">cellular respiration</a>. Using oxygen, cellular respiration converts chemical energy from food to another form of chemical energy called ATP. Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) are by-products of cellular respiration. The potential energy of ATP can be converted to kinetic energy. Some of the kinetic energy is used to do useful work, such as pulling back a bowstring, but the heat energy that is generated cannot be used to do work.
