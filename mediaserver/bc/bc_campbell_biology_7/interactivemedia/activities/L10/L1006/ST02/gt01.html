The primary difference between C<sub>3 </sub> photosynthesis and the C<sub>4</sub> and CAM photosynthetic pathways is in the process of carbon dioxide fixation.<p>As you will recall in C<sub>3 </sub> photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is captured by the Rubisco enzyme and added to RuBP inside the chloroplast. This produces 3&#150;PGA, a three&#150;carbon compound that gives the C<sub>3 </sub> process its name.<p>In C<sub>4 </sub> and CAM photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is fixed in the cytoplasm of the mesophyll cells, not inside the chloroplasts.<p>Carbon dioxide enters these cells by diffusion from the stoma.<p>C<sub>4 </sub> plants have a special carbon acceptor molecule, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). PEP carboxylase, a highly efficient enzyme, reacts with carbon dioxide and PEP to produce oxaloacetate, a four&#150;carbon compound that gives C<sub>4 </sub> photosynthesis its name.<p>The oxaloacetate quickly is converted into aspartic or malic acid (both of which are also 4&#150;carbon molecules).<p>You will notice that C<sub>4 </sub> photosynthesis uses an ATP molecule to fix the carbon dioxide. This energy expense is compensated by the reduction of photorespiration in conditions limiting the availability of carbon dioxide.<p>This use of ATP in the C<sub>4 </sub> process makes the C<sub>4 </sub> pathway more efficient in conditions with little photorespiration.
