By studying various fossil records, geologists have put together a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('geologicrecord.html');return false;">geologic record</a>. Evidence in the fossil record of large-scale extinctions and/or enormous radiation of many diverse new life forms defines the main boundaries within the geologic record. Learn more about the evolutionary events by grabbing the yellow arrow and moving the slide bar. As you move through the record, the names and dates will change. Also, a diagram at the upper left will show what is known of the history of continental drift, based on evidence dating from the Mesozoic Era.
