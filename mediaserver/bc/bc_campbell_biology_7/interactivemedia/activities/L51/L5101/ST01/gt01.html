Worker bees must communicate to one another the location of food sources, which may change as flowers bloom and fade. One way bees do this is by dancing. When a worker returns to the hive, it is quickly surrounded by other workers, who sense its movements. The round dance seems to communicate simply that there is food nearby. If food is farther from the hive, a worker appears to communicate both the direction and distance of the food through the waggle dance.
