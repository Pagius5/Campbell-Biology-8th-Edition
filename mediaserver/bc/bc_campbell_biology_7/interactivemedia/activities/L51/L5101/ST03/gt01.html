The distance to the food source may be up to five kilometers from the hive. The distance seems to be communicated by several elements of the waggle dance, such as the speed at which a worker completes the cycles of the dance and the length of the straight run, and thus the number of waggles. The angle of the straight run relative to vertical is the same as the horizontal angle of the food in relation to the sun. In this case, the food source lies a few degrees to the right of the sun. The dancer may also regurgitate nectar to communicate the kind of food to look for. Thus, the dance seems to communicate to other workers the distance, direction, and type of food to seek.
