Binding of signal molecules causes two <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('polypeptides.html');return false;">polypeptides</a> to join, activating parts of each that act as tyrosine-kinase enzymes, which then phosphorylate tyrosines in the tail of the other polypeptide.<p>The receptor protein is now recognized by specific relay proteins inside the cell. One receptor tyrosine kinase may activate several relay proteins at once, triggering several different effects within the cell.<p>Click on another receptor type.
