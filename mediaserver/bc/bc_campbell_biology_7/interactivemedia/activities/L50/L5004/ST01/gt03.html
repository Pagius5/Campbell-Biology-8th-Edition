1. Correct. Sparse rainfall (less than 30 cm per year) largely determines that an area will be a desert. Some deserts have soil surface temperatures above 60 degrees C during the day. Other deserts, such as those west of the Rocky Mountains and in central Asia, are relatively cold. Evolutionary adaptations of desert plants and animals include a remarkable array of mechanisms that store water. The pleated structure of some cacti enables the plants to expand when they absorb water during wet periods. Some mice never drink, deriving all their water from the metabolic breakdown of the seeds they eat. Many desert plants also rely on <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cam.html');return false;">CAM</a> <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('photosynthesis.html');return false;">photosynthesis</a>, a metabolic adaptation that conserves water in this arid environment. Protective devices that deter feeding by mammals and insects, such as spines on cacti and poisons in the leaves of shrubs, are also common in desert plants.
