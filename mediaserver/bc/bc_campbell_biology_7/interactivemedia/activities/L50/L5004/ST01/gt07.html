3. Good answers. Dense stands of deciduous trees are trademarks of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('temperatedeciduousforests.html');return false;">temperate broadleaf forests</a>. Temperate broadleaf forests occur throughout midlatitudes where there is sufficient moisture to support the growth of large trees. More open than rain forests and not as tall, a mature temperate broadleaf forest has distinct vertical layers, including one or two strata of trees, an understory of shrubs, and an herbaceous stratum. Deciduous forest trees drop their leaves before winter, when temperatures are too low for effective <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('photosynthesis.html');return false;">photosynthesis</a> and water lost through <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('transpiration.html');return false;">transpiration</a> is not easily replaced from frozen soil. Many temperate broadleaf forest mammals also enter a dormant winter state called <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('hibernation.html');return false;">hibernation</a>, and some bird species migrate to warmer climates. Virtually all the original deciduous forests in North America were destroyed by logging and land-clearing for agriculture and urban development. In contrast to drier <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('biomes.html');return false;">biomes</a>, these forests tend to recover after disturbance, and today we see deciduous trees dominating undeveloped areas over much of their former range.
