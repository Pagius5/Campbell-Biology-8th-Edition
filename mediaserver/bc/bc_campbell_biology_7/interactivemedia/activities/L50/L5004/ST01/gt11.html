Permafrost (permanently frozen subsoil), bitterly cold temperatures, and high winds are responsible for the absence of trees and other tall plants in the arctic <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('tundra.html');return false;">tundra</a>. Although the arctic tundra receives very little annual rainfall, water cannot penetrate the underlying permafrost and accumulates in pools on the shallow topsoil during the short summer.

High winds and cold temperatures create similar plant communities, called alpine tundra, on very high mountaintops at all latitudes, including the tropics.
