6. Right. The veldts of South Africa, the pampas of Argentina and Uruguay, the steppes of Asia, and the plains and prairies of central North America are all temperate grasslands. The key to the persistence of grasslands is seasonal drought, occasional fires, and grazing by large mammals, all of which prevent woody shrubs and trees from becoming established. Temperate grasslands once covered much of central North America. Because grassland soil is both deep and rich in nutrients, these habitats provide fertile land for agriculture. Most grassland in the United States has been converted to farmland, and very little natural prairie exists today.
