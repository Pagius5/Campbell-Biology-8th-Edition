2. Right. Cone-bearing trees, such as pine, spruce, fir, and hemlock dominate <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('coniferous.html');return false;">coniferous</a> forests. Coastal coniferous forests of the U.S. Pacific Northwest are actually temperate rain forests. Warm, moist air from the Pacific Ocean supports these unique communities, which like most coniferous forests are dominated by one or a few tree species. Extending in a broad band across northern North America and Eurasia to the southern border of the arctic <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('tundra.html');return false;">tundra</a>, the northern coniferous forest, or <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('taiga.html');return false;">taiga</a>, is the largest terrestrial <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('biome.html');return false;">biome</a> on Earth. Taiga receives heavy snowfall during winter. The conical shape of many <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('conifers.html');return false;">conifers</a> prevents too much snow from accumulating on and breaking their branches. Coniferous forests are being logged at an alarming rate, and the old-growth stands of these trees may soon disappear.
