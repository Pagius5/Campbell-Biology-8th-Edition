4. Correct. <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('tropicalrainforests.html');return false;">Tropical rain forests</a> have pronounced vertical stratification. Trees in the canopy make up the topmost stratum. The canopy is often closed, with little light reaching the ground below. When an opening does occur, perhaps because of a fallen tree, other trees and large woody vines grow rapidly, competing for light and space as they fill the gap. Many of the trees are covered with <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('epiphytes.html');return false;">epiphytes</a> (plants that grow on other plants rather than in soil), such as orchids and bromeliads. Rainfall, which is quite variable in the tropics, is the prime determinant of the vegetation growing in an area. In lowland areas that have a prolonged dry season or scarce rainfall at any time, tropical thorn forests predominate. The plants found there are a mixture of thorny shrubs, trees, and succulents. In regions with distinct wet and dry seasons, tropical deciduous forests dominate.
