A tree reaches its imposing size by combining <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('primarygrowth.html');return false;">primary</a> and <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('secondarygrowth.html');return false;">secondary growth</a>. This activity reviews the two kinds of growth.<p>Can you recognize primary and secondary growth when you see them? Here you see the tip of a tree, with the taper of the stem exaggerated for clarity. Click on the "Grow" button to see it grow. Then you'll have the opportunity to point out the growth regions.
