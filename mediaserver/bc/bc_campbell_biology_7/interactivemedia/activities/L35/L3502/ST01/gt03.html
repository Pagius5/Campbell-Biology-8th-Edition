As you just saw, some parts of a tree undergo primary growth at the same time that other parts undergo <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('secondarygrowth.html');return false;">secondary growth</a>. If the roots were visible, you would see the same thing in the roots.<p><a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('primarygrowth.html');return false;">Primary growth</a> occurs in young leaves and elongating parts of stems and roots. <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('apicalmeristems.html');return false;">Apical meristems</a> (regions of rapid cell division) provide cells for primary growth. Secondary growth occurs in regions of stems or roots that have completed their elongation. Leaves never have secondary growth.<p>Secondary growth doesn't occur in many short-lived <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('eudicots.html');return false;">eudicots</a> and most <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('monocots.html');return false;">monocots</a>, such as palms and grasses.
