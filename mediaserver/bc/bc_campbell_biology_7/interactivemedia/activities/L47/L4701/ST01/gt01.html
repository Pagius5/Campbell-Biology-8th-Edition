Biologists have learned a lot about <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('fertilization.html');return false;">fertilization</a> and embryonic development by observing and experimenting with sea urchins. Sea urchin eggs are fertilized externally after the animals release their <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('gametes.html');return false;">gametes</a> into the water. Fertilization and subsequent development are similar to the changes that occur in the early embryos of mammals, but they are much easier to observe in sea urchin embryos.
