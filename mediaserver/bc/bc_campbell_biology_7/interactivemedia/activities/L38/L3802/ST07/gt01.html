<a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('seeds.html');return false;">Seeds</a> contain dormant embryos with a food supply and a protective coat. They can usually sense the environment, causing the young plant to resume its growth when conditions favor survival. All seeds need oxygen, warmth, and water to germinate. Some seeds need light too, and others need dark or prolonged chilling or a treatment that weakens the seed coat.  All these requirements help to assure the seedling's survival.  When the root emerges, the seed has germinated.
