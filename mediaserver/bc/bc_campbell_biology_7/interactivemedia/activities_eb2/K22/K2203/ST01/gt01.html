The USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) requires foods sold in stores to have a label that describes nutritional information. The amounts of the most important nutrients for good health are listed on a label according to what is defined as one serving. Select questions by clicking on a number at the bottom of the screen. Explore the food labels by holding your cursor over each food to help you answer each question.
