9. Compare the fat calories to total calories for the burrito and the salad. Which of these two foods has the greatest proportion of fat calories relative to total calories?<br><br>Good job! The salad contains about 32% (18/56 x 100) fat calories relative to total calories but the burrito only has 28% (99/358 x 100) fat calories. Too much fat in the diet increases your risk for heart disease and cancer. The burrito would be the more nutritious choice because it contains a lower proportion of fat calories.
