10. Jason is 2 years old and weighs only 12 pounds. He lives with his mother, three sisters, and two brothers in a small apartment in a big city. He is often sad and withdrawn. He is thinner and shorter than other children of his age. Jason usually gets to eat his fill of potatoes for dinner and dried cereal for breakfast.  He almost never gets any milk to drink.  Jason often feels chilled and needs to be wrapped in blankets to keep warm.
