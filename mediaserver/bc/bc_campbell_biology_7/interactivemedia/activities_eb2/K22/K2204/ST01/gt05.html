4. Peter is a 28-year-old man that lives in a cardboard box in a big city. Since he lost his job many years ago, he has lived on the street by eating whatever he could find. Peter's hair has partly fallen out and his gums sometimes bleed. He finds that he catches colds easily. Although Peter knows about food banks and missions nearby, he is not comfortable seeking food from those places. Most of the time, Peter doesn't feel like walking much farther than the garbage dumpsters at the end of the alley.
