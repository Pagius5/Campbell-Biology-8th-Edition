6. Francine is one and a half years old and weighs only eight pounds. She is shorter and smaller than other one year olds. Francine was only five months old when her mother contracted pneumonia. Because her mother could not afford to buy formulated breast milk (and could not breast-feed while ill), Francine was weaned very early in her life. She has been given plenty of rice cereal and sometimes oatmeal for meals. Francine doesn't crawl much even though other one year olds are starting to walk. Her mother wonders if Francine is mentally handicapped.
