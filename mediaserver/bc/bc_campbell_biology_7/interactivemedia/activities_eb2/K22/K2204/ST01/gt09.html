8. Juan is a 19-year-old racehorse jockey. He is 5'8'' tall and weighs 110 pounds. It is important to Juan that he prevents any weight gain so he can qualify for his weight division in horse racing. He worries that if he even looks overweight, he'll be fired from his job. Juan's power of self-discipline helps him control what he eats. He uses laxatives when he fears he ate too much during a meal. Juan was briefly hospitalized last year with a low body temperature and irregular heartbeat.
