5. Tran is 22 years old. His weight is about ideal for his height. He works as a manager in a warehouse and lives at home with his family. Tran enjoys eating out in the evenings. When he dines alone, he always overeats. He can hardly wait to get off work to eat. Fearing that his family will be disgusted and ashamed of him if he seems too well fed, he takes vomit inducing drugs and laxatives soon after dinner.  Tran is ashamed of his behavior and knows it is abnormal. Yet he doesn't know how to stop.
