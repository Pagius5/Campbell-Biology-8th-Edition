9. Raisa is 32 years old. She works as a receptionist in a dental office. Raisa is 5'7" tall and weighs 140 pounds (close to her ideal acceptable weight). She frequently thinks about food when she is working, and eats large amounts of cookies and cake at lunchtime. Raisa is often depressed about her weight; so much so that she forces herself to vomit in the bathroom whenever she goes on an eating spree. Raisa hides her cycles of overeating and vomiting carefully, so that no one at work knows about her problem. She is concerned that she will be criticized at work if she looks fat.
