3. Anne is a 26-year-old ballerina. She is 5'8" tall and weighs 130 pounds. Ann eats a vegetarian diet that includes a variety of foods, including soybeans, cheese, and milk. She is very careful what she eats so that she does not gain weight appreciably. Still, her weight fluctuates a few pounds up or down over the course of a few months. While she wishes she weighed less, Ann knows that eating poorly will affect her ability to perform ballet.
