7. Gabriella is 23-years-old and works as a computer programmer. She is 5'6" tall and weighs 200 pounds.  When Gabriella isn't staring at a computer screen at work, she's watching television at home. She likes to watch TV programs until late at night. At work, Gabriella often buys pastries and ice cream from the vending machines to supplement the large lunches she brings from home. Her employer also puts out free candy and peanuts, which Gabriella eats in large handfuls. She always drives to work and takes the elevator up to her office. She never exercises.
