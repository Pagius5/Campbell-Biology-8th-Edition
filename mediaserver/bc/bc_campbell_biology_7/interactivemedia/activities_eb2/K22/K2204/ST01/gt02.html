1. Tonya is 16 years old. She is a model for trendy women's clothes. Tonya weighs 120 pounds and is 5' 11'' tall.  She is very conscious of the calories in the foods that she eats and strictly limits her meals to low calorie foods.  Tonya is often exhausted and hungry, but tells herself that she is rested and full. Tonya often thinks she has eaten too much and so she exercises vigorously to prevent any weight gain. When Tonya looks in the mirror, she sees herself as fat. She does not believe she has any kind of problem, even though she stopped menstruating over 5 months ago.
