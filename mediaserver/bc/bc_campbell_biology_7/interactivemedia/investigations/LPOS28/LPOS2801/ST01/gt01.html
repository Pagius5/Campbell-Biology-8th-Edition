Protists are a remarkably diverse group of organisms found in a variety of habitats. In this activity we will look at four informal groups of protists: <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('protozoan.html');return false;">protozoans</a>, slime molds, unicellular <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('algae.html');return false;">algae</a>, and multicellular algae that are commonly called seaweeds. Although these informal names are useful in discussing protist ecology, keep in mind that they do not refer to monophyletic groups. In this activity you will investigate protists collected from various habitats: fresh water, salt water, soil, and specimens from animals.<p>
1. Before beginning this activity, click on the Questions window and answer Question 1.<p>
