Congratulations on completing all the calculations you will need from your field data!<p>

You are now ready to proceed with interpreting your data. You should spend some time now reviewing your data and looking for patterns. <p>

Note the plot icon (PPLOTIMAGEE) next to each target group in your notebook. Clicking on these will display a plot of the data for that target group. Look at a few of these plots and make sure you understand how the data produces the plot.<p>
Click on the Next button when you are ready to proceed.
