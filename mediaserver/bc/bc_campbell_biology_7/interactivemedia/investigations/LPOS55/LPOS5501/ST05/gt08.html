Good job! The percent colonization for the rest of the sites have been filled in for you.<p>
As you can see, you have filled in another part of the Lab Notebook. You are almost done. However, at this point, you have only looked at total percent colonization for each site.<p>
Restoration efforts often find that each target group shows a unique pattern of colonization, due to special <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('adaptation.html');return false;">adaptations</a> or <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('habitat.html');return false;">habitat</a> characteristics. Prairies R Us therefore also wants to know if colonization differs within target groups at different sites and if colonization patterns differ between target groups through time. <p>

Similar equations are used to calculate the percent colonization of each target group at each site. Using the equation shown, calculate the percentage of colonization by grasses for site 1 for the initial sample. Recall that there are four grass species available to colonize from the native grassland. Round your answer to the nearest percentage.<p>
Click on "Check Calculation". If you've entered the correct answer, the percent colonization will be filled in for the rest of the target groups, sites, and samples.
