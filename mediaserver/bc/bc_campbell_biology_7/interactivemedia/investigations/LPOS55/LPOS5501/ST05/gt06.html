The equation shown here can be used to calculate total percent colonization for each site. This metric tells you what percentage of the available source pool actually colonized the restoration site.<p>
Remember, including all target groups, there were 14 potential colonizers.<p>
Using the equation, calculate the percentage of colonization for site 1 for each sampling time using totals from the Lab Notebook. Round your answer to the nearest percentage.<p>
Click on "Check Calculation". If you've entered the correct answer, the percent colonization will be filled in for the rest of the sites.
