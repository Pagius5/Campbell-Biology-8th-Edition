Sorry, that's not correct. Did you enter the percent colonization for both the initial and the six-month sample?<p>
Try your calculation again, and remember to round your answer to the nearest whole number. Recall that the total number of species is 14. <p>

Click on "Check Calculation". If you've entered the correct answer, the total percent colonization will be filled in for the rest of the sites and samples.
