Excellent choice. The distance of site #4 from existing prairie makes it more difficult for some less mobile species to colonize.<p>
Great job in collecting data for all four sites. However, as you can see from your field notebook, there are still some gaps in the data needed for your report to Prairies R Us.<p>
Remember that Prairies R Us wants to know if total species number changes over time at the different sites. Click on the Sample button to do additional sampling six months after your initial sampling.
