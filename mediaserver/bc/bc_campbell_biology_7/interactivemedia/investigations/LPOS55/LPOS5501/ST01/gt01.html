<p>Concepts of the theory of island biogeography are applicable not only to oceanic islands but also to very isolated ecosystems.  For example, colonization of mountain lakes, natural areas within agricultural fields, and clear-cut areas generally follow patterns that would be predicted by island biogeography.  The theory of island biogeography has also been used to design nature preserves. To review the theory of island biogeography, see Chapter 53 and the Chapter 53 activity titled "Exploring Island Biogeography."</p><p>In this field experiment, you will use ideas contained within the theory of island biogeography to restore a tall-grass prairie in Iowa.  You will use the Lab Notebook below to record your data.</p>
