You will sample four restored prairie sites of two different sizes (1 acre and 10 acres) and two distances (1 km and 25 km) from an existing tall-grass prairie. You will compare the abilities of various species to colonize the restored sites.<p>

You should open your Lab Notebook now by clicking on the cover. Note that there are four main columns in the table &#8212; one for each of the four restoration sites. You will be entering data in these columns as you collect samples from the four restoration sites.<p>
Also note the plot icons <img src="plot.gif" border="0"> next to each target group in your notebook. These don't work right now, but later on you will use them to display a plot of your data. <p>

Click on restoration site #1 to begin evaluation of this site.
