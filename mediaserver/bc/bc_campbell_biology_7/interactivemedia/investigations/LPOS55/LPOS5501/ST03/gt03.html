Welcome to restoration site #1. This site is a small (1 acre) prairie that lies closeto existing prairie (1 km) and was just restored.<p>
Your primary objective is to determine the number of species present for each of the prairie target groups.
You will be using three different sampling methods:<ul>
1. A quadrat is a rectangular frame that is thrown randomly into the prairie. It is used to sample for grass and grasshopper species.<p>
2. The binoculars are used to scan for foxes and birds.<p>
3. The traps are used to sample for rodents.
</ul>
For the purpose of this activity, the sampling procedure is simplified. Keep in mind that actual sampling for habitat assessment is much more difficult and is subject to random factors. Also, federal laws regulate the sampling of vertebrate animals.<p>
Click on the quadrat, binoculars, or trap to sample for the appropriate species. Then click on the Lab Notebook below to begin recording your data.
