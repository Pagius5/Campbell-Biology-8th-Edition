Plants have a remarkable ability to replace lost organs&#8212; roots and shoots. Control of organ initiation involves <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('hormones.html');return false;">hormones</a>, and we exploit this fact commercially to grow plants from stem cuttings, blocks of tissue, or single cells.<p>
You're working at a biotech company, and you've been asked to experiment on a block of tissue from a previously unstudied plant. Choose the two hormones that you think are most likely to induce organ formation&#8212; the development of roots or shoots. Drag two droppers to the empty dish. Then drag the tissue to the empty dish and watch the results. Good luck!
