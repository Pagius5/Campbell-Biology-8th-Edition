<a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('enzymes.html');return false;">Enzymes</a> catalyze reactions by lowering the activation energy necessary for a reaction to occur. In this investigation, you will explore how the rate of enzyme catalysis is measured.<p>
Enzymes catalyze reactions by lowering the activation energy necessary for a reaction to occur. The molecule that an enzyme acts on is called the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('substrate.html');return false;">substrate</a>. In an enzyme-mediated reaction, substrate molecules are changed and product is formed. The enzyme molecule is unchanged after the reaction, and it can continue to catalyze the same type of reaction over and over.<p>
Each enzyme is specific for the reaction it will catalyze. In the example shown at left,<p>
Enzyme = catalase<br>
Substrate = hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<br>
Products = water and oxygen<p>
If a small amount of catalase is added to hydrogen peroxide, you will observe bubbles of oxygen forming.
