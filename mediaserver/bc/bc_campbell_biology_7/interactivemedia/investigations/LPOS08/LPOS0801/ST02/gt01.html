We can calculate the rate at which an enzyme converts substrate to product by measuring, over time, either the disappearance of substrate or the appearance of product (as in the graph at the left). For example, based on the graph, what is the rate, in moles/second, over the interval from 0 to 10 seconds?<p>Rate = &#916;<i>y</i>/&#916;<i>x</i><p>
So for this example, the rate would be<p>
<ul>
(7 moles - 0 moles)/(10 seconds - 0 seconds) =<p>
7/10 =<p>
0.7 moles/second
</ul>
<p>
See the Sample Problem at left. Calculate the rate and check your answer.
