You take a thin sliver of tissue from one of the skin lesions of your AIDS patient, and stain it with a dye that makes <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('nuclei.html');return false;">nuclei</a> purple and <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cytoplasm.html');return false;">cytoplasm</a> mostly pinkish.<p>
The normal cells are a bit more bluish and toward the right side of the photograph, and the abnormal cells of the nodule are on the left. The nuclei of eukaryotic cells stain somewhat darker than the cytoplasm with this particular stain.<p>
3. Observe and record the differences between the abnormal and normal cell types.<p>
4. Answer Question 3.<p>
These lesions are the patient's own cells growing inappropriately, invading normal tissue, and disrupting its structure; in other words, a cancer. This type is called Kaposi's sarcoma. A sarcoma is a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('tumor.html');return false;">tumor</a> of solid tissues.<p>
Think about the relationship between the Kaposi's sarcoma cells and HIV. How does HIV stimulate the growth of the tumor? This is an indirect effect. The tumor cells grow in an HIV-infected person not because the virus directly acts on the person's cells causing them to become cancerous, but because the virus kills the white blood cells whose job it is to recognize newly-formed cancer cells and kill them.<p>
This cancer of the blood vessels that line the skin is rare in the general population, but it affects up to 70% of men with AIDS. Physicians can now eradicate these tumors with high success using chemotherapy with agents such as bleomycin, which interferes with <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('dna.html');return false;">DNA</a> synthesis, and actinomycin D, which inhibits <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('rna.html');return false;">RNA</a> synthesis.
