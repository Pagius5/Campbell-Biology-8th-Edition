One of the four patients first diagnosed with AIDS  had abnormal growths, or nodules, on his leg and foot, similar to those shown in the photo at left.<p>
You want to know whether the nodules are caused by an infecting organism, or whether they are abnormal growths of the patient's own cells.<p>
1. On a sheet of paper, sketch what you observe in the photo at left and write a description of the symptoms in your Lab Notebook.<p>
2. After observing the skin with the naked eye, your next step is to perform a microscopic examination of the nodules. Click on the Micrograph button.
