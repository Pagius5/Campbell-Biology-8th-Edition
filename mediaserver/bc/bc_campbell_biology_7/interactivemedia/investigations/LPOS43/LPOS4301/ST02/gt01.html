To take a closer look, you and your pathologist colleague decide to cut a very thin slice containing the black regions. You color the material with a dye that stains human lung cells green.<p>
In your preparation, shown in the micrograph at left, the cells of the disease-causing (pathogenic) organisms are spherical and dark, with a black spot in the middle. The disease-causing cells are a bit bigger than the green-stained human lung cells. Two green human cells are especially evident in the lower right clear region of the micrograph.<p>
1. On a sheet of paper, sketch what you observe in the micrograph of infected lung cells. Write a description in your Lab Notebook.<p>
2. Click on the Diagram button to compare your sketch with one made by a physician.
