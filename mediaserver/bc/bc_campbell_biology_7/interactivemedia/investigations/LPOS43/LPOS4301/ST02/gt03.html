To help your patients, you want to treat this infection by administering a drug that will kill the invading organisms. To choose the right drug, you need to know if these invading cells are <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('prokaryoticcells.html');return false;">prokaryotic cells</a> or eukaryotic cells.<p>
5. Compare the micrograph of infected lung cells with what you know about prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, and write your observations in the "Micrograph of infected lung cells" section of your Lab Notebook.<p>
6. Answer Question 2.<p>
The lung infection was caused by the species <i>Pneumocystis carinii</i>. It is a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('fungus.html');return false;">fungus</a>, as are <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('yeast.html');return false;">yeast</a> and mushrooms.<p>
Think about the relationship of the <i>Pneumoniae carinii</i> cells and <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('hiv.html');return false;">HIV</a>. How does HIV stimulate the growth of <i>Pneumoniae carinii</i>? This is an indirect effect. The fungal cells grow in an HIV-infected person not because the virus directly acts on the fungus, but because the virus kills the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('whitebloodcells.html');return false;">white blood cells</a> whose job it is to kill the invading eukaryotic cells.<p>
Drugs are available to slow the growth of these organisms. You will consider prescribing these drugs for your AIDS patients with this type of lung infection in the future.
