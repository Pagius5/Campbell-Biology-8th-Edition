You are a physician helping people who have <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('aids.html');return false;">AIDS</a>. To diagnose and treat their conditions, you need to find out what types of organisms are causing their various opportunistic infections. Opportunistic infections are caused by microorganisms that can cause disease in individuals whose general health is compromised &#151; especially by malfunction of the immune system as in AIDS.<p>
By examining samples of diseased tissue, you can determine what types of cells are causing the infections. You and your pathologist colleague acquire some lung tissue from a patient who died of a rare lung infection. You examine the tissue under a dissecting microscope and cut it with a scalpel. The image at left shows your section of the diseased lungs with a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('bloodvessel.html');return false;">blood vessel</a> coursing through it diagonally, and a few circles that are the cross sections of blood vessels.<p>
1. Examine this lung tissue sample. Then click on the Lab Notebook and record your observations. Which aspect of this diseased lung might represent damage (or "lesions") resulting from the pneumonia-causing organism?<p>2. Click on the Questions window and answer Question 1.
