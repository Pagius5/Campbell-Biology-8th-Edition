In this activity, you will investigate the spread of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('aids.html');return false;">AIDS</a> in the United States. You will propose a hypothesis that could explain why different regions of the country have different rates of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('hiv.html');return false;">HIV</a> infection. You will then test the predictions of your hypothesis against data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<p>
Biologists know that the virus called HIV causes AIDS. But how do they  know that? <i>Epidemiology</i>, the study of the spread of disease through populations, suggests that an infectious agent causes AIDS. Epidemiologists initially realized that AIDS was particularly prevalent in homosexual men, intravenous drug users, and people with <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('hemophilia.html');return false;">hemophilia</a>. While these were the first groups in which AIDS was found to be particularly prevalent, today we know that AIDS can be spread to anyone by sexual contact.<p>
1. Review the list to the left. What do the initially identified groups have in common? Click on the Lab Notebook window and record similarities between these groups.<p>
2. Click on the Questions window and use your observations to answer Question 1.
