The incidence of AIDS is not the same in every location across the U.S. In some states and cities, the rate of HIV infection and AIDS is higher than in others.<p>
The CDC maintains a database of statistics on the incidence of AIDS.  By tracking the frequency of a disease in local populations, the CDC hopes to identify factors that various places have in common that may contribute to increased risk for a disease. Knowing these risk factors, they can make recommendations aimed at curbing the spread of the disease.<p>
You are ready to start your epidemiological research. Your first question to answer is: <i>Which two areas have the highest rate of AIDS? </i><p>
1. To answer this question scientifically, you need to formulate a hypothesis. The hypothesis should answer the question: <i>What geographic  or local population factors affect the rate of AIDS?</i> Answer Question 2.<p>
2. In your Lab Notebook, write a prediction based on this hypothesis. Which two areas does your hypothesis predict will have the highest incidence of AIDS? Why would your hypothesis suggest these areas?<p>3. Check your prediction against the actual statistics in the CDC database at left.<p>
4. Analyze the data at left to find out which areas actually have the <i>highest</i> AIDS rates. Record this data in your Lab Notebook.<p>
5. Did your hypothesis predict these results correctly? Why or why not? If not, modify your hypothesis to better account for the data. Record this information in your Lab Notebook.<p>
6. Answer Question 3.<p>
7. Try testing your modified hypothesis by predicting the two areas with the <i>lowest</i> rates of AIDS cases. Record your new prediction in your Lab Notebook.<p>
8. Using the table at left, look up which areas actually have the <i>lowest</i> rates of AIDS cases, and record this information in your Lab Notebook.<p>
9. Did your modified hypothesis correctly predict the areas with the <i>lowest</i> rates of AIDS? If not, modify your hypothesis again in your Lab Notebook, and retest it by looking at the data for the 3rd- and 4th- <i>highest</i> and <i>lowest</i> areas in the database. Keep testing your hypothesis until you can accurately predict the results. Then answer Question 4.
