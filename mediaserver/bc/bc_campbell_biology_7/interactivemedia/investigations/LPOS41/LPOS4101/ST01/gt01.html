In this investigation, you will study the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('hydrolysis.html');return false;">hydrolysis</a> of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('starch.html');return false;">starch</a> to maltose by salivary amylase, the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('enzyme.html');return false;">enzyme</a> produced by the salivary glands and secreted into the mouth.<p>
<b>Incubation</b><br>
Begin by dragging seven test tubes from the Test Tube Washer at the far left to the test tube holders numbered 1 through 7 on the incubation unit.<p>
Prepare tubes 1 through 7 with substances from the dropper bottles by dragging their caps over each test tube according to the following combinations. (If you make a mistake, drag the test tube to the Test Tube Washer. Then drag a new test tube to the holder.)<br>
1. Amylase + Starch + pH 7.0 buffer<br>
2. Amylase + Starch + pH 7.0 buffer<br>
3. Amylase + Deionized water + pH 7.0 buffer<br>
4. Deionized water + Starch + pH 7.0 buffer<br>
5. Deionized water + Maltose + pH 7.0 buffer<br>
6. Amylase + Starch + pH 2.0 buffer<br>
7. Amylase + Starch + pH 9.0 buffer<p>
Click on the holder for test tube 1 to lower the test tube into the incubation unit. Click Boil. After tube 1 boils for a few moments, it will automatically rise. Now set the incubation temperature to 37&#176;C and the timer to 60 minutes. Now click the Incubate button to incubate all the test tubes. (The incubation will stop automatically when the Elapsed Time counter reaches 60.)<p>
<b>Assays</b><br>
Because the chemical changes that occur as starch is digested to maltose cannot be seen by the naked eye, you will conduct an enzyme assay, the chemical method of detecting the presence of digested substances. You will perform two enzyme assays&#8212; the IKI assay, which detects the presence of starch, and the Benedict's assay, which tests for the presence of maltose.<p>
First, drag each tube from the incubation unit to the assay tubes in the assay cabinet. Watch the tube automatically decant approximately half of its contents into the assay tube. Next, add IKI to each assay tube. A blue-black color indicates a positive starch test. If starch is not present, the mixture looks like diluted IKI, a negative starch test. Intermediate starch amounts result in a pale gray color.<p>
Now dispense Benedict's reagent into the remaining mixture in each tube in the incubation unit by dragging and dropping the Benedict's dropper cap to each tube. After Benedict's reagent has been delivered, click Boil. When the rack of tubes rises, inspect the tubes for color change. A green or a reddish color indicates that maltose is present; this is a positive sugar test. An orange-colored sample contains more maltose than a green sample. A reddish-brown color indicates even more maltose. A negative sugar test is indicated by no color change from the original bright blue.<p>
