Correct. The middle tree best fits the data. There are 10 differences in amino acid sequence between species B and C, 11 differences between A and B, but only 3 differences between A and C. Species A and C appear to be more closely related to each other than either is to B. The data suggest that species B is a distant relative of A and C, and that species A and C diverged from each other more recently.<p>
Incidentally, these data are based on comparisons of cytochrome c from a dog, a horse, and a rattlesnake. The dog and horse, which are mammals, are more closely related to each other than they are to the rattlesnake, which is a reptile.
