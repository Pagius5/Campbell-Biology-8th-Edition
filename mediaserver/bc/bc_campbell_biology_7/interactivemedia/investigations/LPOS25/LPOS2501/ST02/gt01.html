Differences in protein amino acid sequences reflect differences in DNA base sequences. This activity allows you to compare amino acid sequences of proteins from different species and use them to deduce evolutionary relationships.<p>
1. Click on the Questions window and answer Question 1.<p>
At left are three comparisons of amino acid sequences of the electron transport protein cytochrome c from three species of animals, designated by the capital letters A, B, and C. Each amino acid in the proteins is represented by a small letter. The differences in amino acid sequence are highlighted. (Note that for the purposes of this activity, the data are simplified.)<p>
2. For each one of the three comparisons, count the differences in the amino acid sequence. Then click on the appropriate arrow in the chart to choose the correct number of differences.
