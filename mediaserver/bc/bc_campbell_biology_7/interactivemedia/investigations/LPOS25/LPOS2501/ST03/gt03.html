This phylogenetic tree best corresponds to the amino acid sequence data. Species A is the horse. Clearly, its closest relative is the donkey. The horse, donkey, and rabbit are all mammals. The two birds are fairly closely related to each other. The birds and the mammals are all vertebrates, and the tree shows their common heritage. The fruit fly and moth share a common evolutionary path, but it has been a long time since the insects diverged from the vertebrates.
