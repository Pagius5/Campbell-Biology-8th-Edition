If you understand the basics, you can now use amino acid sequences to construct a more elaborate phylogenetic tree, for seven species of animals identified by the capital letters A through G. (Until you complete your assessment of the data, the species will be identified only by capital letters, so your prior knowledge of their evolutionary relationships will not bias your decisions.)<p>
4. To compare the cytochrome c amino acid sequences of two species, click on one of the white boxes. Look at the proteins shown, count the differences, and then select the number of differences in the sequences from the menu. Repeat this procedure until you have filled in all of the white boxes.
