Now we will investigate the source of food poisoning bacteria identified with hamburgers sold at three restaurants. The restaurants purchased their hamburgers from three different suppliers who used meat from one meat processing plant. The restaurants and hamburger suppliers claim the bacterial contamination occurred at the meat processing plant.<p>
To identify the source of bacterial contamination, we will use variations in the amino acid sequence of the tryptophan synthetase A protein. Geneticists have identified three regions of the tryptophan synthetase A gene having predictable base pair <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('mutations.html');return false;">mutations</a>. These spontaneous mutations are passed on through <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('binaryfission.html');return false;">binary fission</a> and are generally unique to a recent lineage of a particular bacterium. They affect the protein by substituting the amino acids on the point mutation site. <p>
Click on one of the hamburgers at left to compare the tryptophan synthetase A amino acid sequence of its bacteria with that of the bacteria in the beef from the meat plant.
