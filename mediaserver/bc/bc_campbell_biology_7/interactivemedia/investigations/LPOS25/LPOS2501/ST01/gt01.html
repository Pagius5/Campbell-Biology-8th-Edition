Researchers compare molecules, as well as anatomical structures, to classify organisms and reconstruct evolutionary trees. <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('dna.html');return false;">DNA</a> and <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('rna.html');return false;">RNA</a> base sequences from closely related species are similar. As you can see in this diagram, there are greater differences in sequence between species that are less closely related&#8212; those whose evolutionary paths diverged a longer time ago.
