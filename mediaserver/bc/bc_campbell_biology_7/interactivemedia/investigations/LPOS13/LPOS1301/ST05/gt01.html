Analyze the spore patterns in the labeled asci in this micrograph of <i>Sordaria</i>. Occasionally, asci rupture and spores escape, so you'll see some loose spores. Don't include them in your count. Also, some asci are only partly visible. Analyze the connected spores in each ascus to determine whether there is clear evidence of a crossover. For example, you can only see six spores of ascus number 1, but their pattern is clear evidence of crossing over.<p>
If the ascospores show clear evidence of being arranged 4 dark/4 light, count the ascus as "No crossing over." If the ascospores are arranged in any other combination, count the ascus as "Crossing over." Place an 'X' in the appropriate column in your Lab Notebook.<p>
Review your data, and answer Question 1.<p>
By studying the frequency of crossing over, you can gather information that lets you draw a map of the relative location of genes on a chromosome. A map unit is a relative measure of the distance between two linked genes, or between a gene and the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('centromere.html');return false;">centromere</a>. The greater the number of crossovers, the greater the map distance.<p>
From the crossing over data you gathered for <I>Sordaria</I>, you will be able to calculate the map distance between the gene for spore color and the centromere. To find the number of map units, you divide the percent of crossovers by 2. Why divide by two? Each crossover produces two spores like the parents and two spores that are a result of the crossover. Thus, to determine the number of crossovers, you must divide the number of asci counted by two since only half the spores in each ascus result from crossing over. Calculate the map distance and then answer Question 2.
