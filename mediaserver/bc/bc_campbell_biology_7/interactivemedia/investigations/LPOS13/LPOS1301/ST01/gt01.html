In this investigation, you will explore how crossing over occurs during meiosis in the fungus <i>Sordaria</i>. Meiosis follows phases similar to those in mitosis, but the outcome of the process is very different. The DNA of the parent cells is replicated in interphase preceding both mitosis and meiosis. However, in meiosis, replication is followed by two divisions.<p>
Meiosis reduces the chromosome number of the parent cell so that four daughter cells are produced, each with one-half the chromosome number of the parent cell. Each daughter cell contains only one chromosome from each homologous pair.<p>
The first stage of meiosis I, prophase I, is shown at left. Note how the chromosomes condense during prophase I. Also, crossing over rearranges genetic material. Click on the image to view the next stage.
