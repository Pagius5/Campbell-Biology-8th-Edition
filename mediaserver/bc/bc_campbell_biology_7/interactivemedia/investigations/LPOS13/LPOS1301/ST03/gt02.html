Two zygotes in which DNA replication has occurred are shown at left. Note the genes for spore color are shown in tan and black on each chromosome. In one zygote, crossing over occurs; in the other, it does not. Compare the results of meiosis I and meiosis II for each.<p>
Four black ascospores in a row next to four tan ascospores in a row indicates that crossing over has NOT occurred. Any other arrangement of ascospores indicates that crossing over has taken place.
