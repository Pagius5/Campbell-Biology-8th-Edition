Observe the results of crossing over in this fungus, <I>Sordaria</I>. In the figure at left, a cross between two haploid strains of <I>Sordaria</I> produces spores of different colors.<p>
Where the growing filaments of the two strains meet, fertilization occurs and zygotes form. Meiosis occurs within fruiting bodies to form haploid ascospores, spores contained in asci (special sacs). Then one mitotic division doubles the number of ascospores to eight. Click on the diagram to study the process of spore formation.
