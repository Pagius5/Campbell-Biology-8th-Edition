Sea urchins release either sperm or eggs into the ocean, where <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('fertilization.html');return false;">fertilization</a> and embryonic development take place.  The pluteus stage is attained after 2-4 days, after which the larva feeds for several weeks before undergoing <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('metamorphosis.html');return false;">metamorphosis</a> into the adult form.  One female sea urchin can spawn up to 20 million eggs, which can be fertilized and undergo embryonic development in the lab.  Development is synchronous, and the embryos are quite clear and transparent, allowing cell behavior to be seen easily.  For these reasons, the sea urchin has long been a valuable model system for researchers studying embryonic development.
