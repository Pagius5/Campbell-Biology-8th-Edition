The great diversity of adult life forms on our planet never fails to amaze us.  Even more remarkable, all multicellular organisms arise from a single cell, the fertilized egg, or <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('zygote.html');return false;">zygote</a>.  Somehow, this single cell gives rise to the ordered arrangement of tissues made up of as many as 200 different cell types, all integrated to function as a single organism.<p>
Each of the four species shown here has attained its unique form through the complex process of embryonic development.  Click on each of the four adult forms to see an image of the embryo that gave rise to that adult.<p>
Understanding embryonic development has long been a passionate interest of our species.  To accomplish this, we study embryonic development of other species (model systems) in which we can more closely observe <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cellulardifferentiation.html');return false;">cell differentiation</a>, or the process by which the descendants of the zygote become different from each other, each specialized to perform a specific function in the whole organism.  The sea urchin is one such important model system from which we have learned a great deal.  This activity will investigate differentiation of a particular cell type in sea urchin embryos that will form the parts of the embryonic skeleton.
