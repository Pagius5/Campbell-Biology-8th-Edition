Fruitflies have been used for experimental studies of genetics and development for almost 100 years.  The <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('zygote.html');return false;">zygote</a> develops into an embryo, then passes through three feeding larval stages before forming a pupa, which will <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('metamorphosis.html');return false;">metamorphose</a> and hatch into an adult fly.  Over the past 15 years, the genetic approach to study genes involved in pattern formation during development has been invaluable in increasing our understanding of these processes.
