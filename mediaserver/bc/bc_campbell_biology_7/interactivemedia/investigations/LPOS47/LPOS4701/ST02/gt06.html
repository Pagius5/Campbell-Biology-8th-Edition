In this stage the digestive tract can be seen extending upward through the center of the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('blastocoel.html');return false;">blastocoel</a> cavity.  It will next bend toward the ectodermal cells nearest the viewer, and fuse with this layer, forming the mouth.<p>
The PMCs have joined together in a horseshoe-shaped latitudinal ring around the inside of the ectodermal cells. The latitude of the PMC ring is one of the embryonic developmental characteristics that will be analyzed in this activity.  At the front ends of the horseshoe, you can see the two triangular clusters of PMCs on the inner surface of the ectodermal cells, appearing on either side of the digestive tract.<p>
The first triradiate spicules of the embryonic skeleton can be seen in these clusters.  Let's identify 2 of the rays, using positions on the face of a clock.  The rays extending toward 12:00  will extend further upward then bend toward the viewer, pushing out the ectoderm to form and support a pair of larval arms above the mouth.  The ray extending toward 4:00 on the right triradiate and 8:00 on the left triradiate will extend slightly backward (away from the digestive tract) and then branch. One branch on each side will extend outward toward the viewer and push the ectoderm outward, forming a second pair of larval arms at the bottom of the embryo.
