In the prism stage the spicules have extended farther, as described previously.  The rays pointing toward 12:00 have extended farther and have bent toward the viewer, initiating the upper pair of larval arms.  The lower rays on the outside have extended slightly and have then branched, with one branch extending into the ectoderm, pushing outward to form the lower pair of larval arms.<p>
The mouth has formed at this stage by fusion of the end of the digestive tract with the ectodermal layer of cells, but it cannot be seen in this face-on view.  In order to see the digestive tract, and to see how the shape of the embryo is changing, we must rotate the embryo 90&#176; to the right, as in the adjacent figure.
