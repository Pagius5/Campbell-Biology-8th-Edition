In this rotated view of the prism stage embryo shown in the figure at left, you can clearly see the digestive tract extending upwards, then breaking through the ectoderm to form the mouth.  You can also see that the oral face of the embryo (the right side, where the mouth is) is somewhat flattened, and buds outward slightly at the top and bottom.  This is where the larval arms are forming, one pair each above and below the mouth.  You can only see one arm of each pair since this is a side view.<p>
These arms will elongate to form the characteristic shape of the pluteus.
