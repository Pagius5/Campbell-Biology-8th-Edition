In the pluteus, the pairs of arms above and below the mouth have grown significantly longer.  The digestive tract has also developed into three parts:  the esophagus, the stomach (round section), and the intestine leading to the anus.<p>
Upon reaching this stage, the pluteus begins to feed, floating around in ocean waters for the next several weeks.  The "feeding larva" gets larger, and the skeleton becomes more elaborate, with the addition of several more pairs of arms.  At the same time, tissues within the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('blastocoel.html');return false;">blastocoel</a> develop into adult sea urchin structures.  At the end of the feeding larval stage, the larva will respond to a specific environmental cue by undergoing a dramatic <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('metamorphosis.html');return false;">metamorphosis</a> into the adult form.  The latter phenomenon is similar to the transformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly.
