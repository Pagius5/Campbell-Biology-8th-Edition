Upon fertilization, the sea urchin egg (now called a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('zygote.html');return false;">zygote</a>) passes through a series of developmental stages shown here, to form the pluteus larva.  (The latter stage resembles an  artist's easel, for which the German word is pluteus.)  This transformation involves cell division, cell migration, and <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('morphogenesis.html');return false;">morphogenesis</a> (generation of form or shape).  The overall shape of the pluteus is established by an internal calcareous skeleton supporting the sheets of tissue.  The skeleton is made up of elements called spicules, formed by a group of cells called the primary mesenchyme cells.  The primary mesenchyme cells (or PMCs) arise from a group of four precursor cells called micromeres, formed during the 4th cleavage.   The process by which the four micromeres turn into the spicule-forming PMCs is a classic example of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cellulardifferentiation.html');return false;">cell differentiation</a> that has been extensively studied.<p>
There are two models of how cells become differentiated to perform specific functions.  In one model, the cell's fate is determined autonomously; that is, the cell contains all the information to become a certain cell type and only that cell type.  In the second model, the cell's fate is determined (or "regulated") by interactions with neighboring cells.  This activity will use PMC transplantation experiments in the sea urchin embryo to investigate the following question:  to what extent is the process of PMC cell differentiation specified autonomously, and to what extent is it regulated by other cells?  We will be analyzing two characteristics of PMC cell behavior to answer this question:  position of the PMC ring, and shape of the skeletal spicules.<p>
Click on each embryonic stage shown here to see a description of the events leading to the next stage, with a special focus on the development of the PMCs.<p>
Then, when you are ready to perform the first set of experiments, continue to the next step.
