In the two sets of experiments you have performed today, you have investigated the differentiation of sea urchin primary mesenchyme cells from the micromeres of the 16-cell stage embryo.  You have evaluated two characteristics of PMC function, both of which contribute to the final form of the pluteus larva.  You have addressed the extent to which PMC function is determined autonomously, or is regulated by other cells.  Review all the data, as well as your answers to Questions 1-4, in order to answer Question 5.  Then click on the "Prediction" button at the bottom of the diagram at left to make a prediction based on your model.
