Recall from the previous screen that the PMCs migrate to form a latitudinal ring lining the inner surface of the outer (ectodermal) layer of cells.  The position of this ring varies from species to species, as shown here for species A and B.  We will perform transplantation experiments in which we remove PMCs from one species (the "donor"), and inject them among the PMCs of another embryo (the "host").  The experiment will be performed at the mesenchyme <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('blastula.html');return false;">blastula</a> stage, when the PMCs have already entered the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('blastocoel.html');return false;">blastocoel</a>, but have not yet migrated to form the PMC ring.  We will observe development to note the position of the ring.<p>
Before beginning these experiments, click on the Questions window and answer Question 1. <p>
You will perform 4 experiments, transplanting PMCs from species A or species B into either species A or species B.<p>
Click on a species to use as a donor.
