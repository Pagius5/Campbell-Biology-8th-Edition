This set of transplantation experiments will be performed the same as the previous set, but in this case we will observe the embryos until the pluteus stage, and assay the form of the skeletal spicules supporting the larval arms.  Some spicules are simple, unbranched rods, whereas others are more complex, composed of two or more supporting rods that are connected by many cross pieces.  The latter are called "fenestrated" spicules.<p>
In species A, simple spicules are formed by the PMCs, whereas in species B, fenestrated spicules are formed.  This set of experiments addresses whether the shape of the spicule is determined autonomously, by the PMCs themselves, or regulated by other cells in the embryo.<p>
