You are performing a control experiment here, as you did in the previous set of experiments.<p>
After the PMCs have been transplanted, click on the button to observe what type of spicules will be formed by the pluteus stage.<p>
Record the type of spicule in the Lab Notebook, next to SF (for Spicule Form) in the appropriate part of the data table.<p>
Click "Reset Experiment" to continue doing additional experiments. When you have done all 4 transplantation experiments, answer Question 4 and go to the next step.
