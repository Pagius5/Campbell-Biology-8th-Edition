This activity provides an example of one experimental approach toward understanding cellular behaviors that constitute embryonic development.   Using this and other approaches, we have learned quite a lot about the formation of the  beautiful sea urchin pluteus embryo shown here.<p>
Cell transplantation experiments have been used in chicken and frog embryos to analyze differentiation of the peripheral nerve cells in vertebrates, as well as other important biological cell types.  It is the aim of developmental biologists that experimental investigations into processes of cell differentiation in a variety of species will complement each other, allowing us to build a model of how embryonic development is carried out.  We are beginning to understand how one single cell can give rise to many different cell types, all functioning harmoniously in an organism.   We are also beginning to understand how different genetic programs of development have evolved, leading to the great diversity of life forms we see today.
