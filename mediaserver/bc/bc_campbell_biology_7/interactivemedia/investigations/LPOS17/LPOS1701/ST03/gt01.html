Now that you have determined the general type of nutritional mutation, the next step is to conduct a second round of screening to determine the specific type of mutation. Each tube shown here contains minimal medium supplemented with 1 of the 20 amino acids. As before, use the loop to collect conidia from the test tube. Then deposit the spores into each of the 20 supplemented test tubes. When you have finished, click on Run Test. After running the test, identify the type of mutation.
