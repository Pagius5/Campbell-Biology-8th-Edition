The test tube on the far left contains <i>Neurospora crassa</i> that has been shown to be a nutritional mutant strain when grown on minimal medium. You need to determine the specific type of mutation. To begin, click and drag the loop to the <i>Neurospora</i> in the tube at the far left to collect conidia, asexual spores. Then drag the loop to each of the labeled supplemented medium test tubes to deposit the conidia. Then click on Run Test to grow the cultures. After running the test, identify the type of mutation.
