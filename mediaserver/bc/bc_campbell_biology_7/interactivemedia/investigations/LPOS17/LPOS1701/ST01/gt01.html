What do orange bread mold and certain human genetic disorders have in common? The key to the answer lies in George Beadle and Edward Tatum's work with metabolic pathways. In this activity, you will use Beadle and Tatum's experimental procedure to identify a nutritional mutation in <i>Neurospora crassa</i>, a common bread mold, and analyze the metabolic pathway affected by that mutation. Then you will investigate how enzyme activity along that pathway is related to inborn errors of metabolism in humans.<p>
<i>(Note: This activity is based on real data concerning Neurospora mutations and human genetic disorders; however, some of the procedures, tests, and results have been modified and/or simplified.)</i><p>
