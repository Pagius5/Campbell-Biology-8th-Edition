The biosynthetic pathway for arginine contains three intermediate products: argininosuccinate, citrulline, and ornithine. In addition, researchers have shown that four genes (known as <i>argE, argF, argG, and argH</i>) are involved in the biosynthesis of arginine in <i>Neurospora</i>. A mutation in any one of the genes gives rise to an arginine-requiring mutant strain. To determine the sequence of the biochemical pathway, you must grow each mutant strain on media supplemented with the arginine precursors.<p>
Click on the loop and drag it to one of the strain test tubes to collect conidia. (The strains labeled with genes are mutant strains.) Deposit conidia from that test tube into the supplemented media test tubes <i>in that row</i>. Repeat the process for each of the mutant strains. Then click on Run Test to grow the cultures. After running the test, identify the arginine synthesis pathway.
