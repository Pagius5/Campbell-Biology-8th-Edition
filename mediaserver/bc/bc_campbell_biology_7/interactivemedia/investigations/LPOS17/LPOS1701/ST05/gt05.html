That's right! Ornithine transcarbamylase catalyzes the formation of citrulline, argininosuccinate synthase catalyzes the formation of argininosuccinate, and argininosuccinate lyase catalyzes the formation of arginine. As you correctly surmised, you were not given enough information to determine the enzyme involved in the formation of ornithine.
