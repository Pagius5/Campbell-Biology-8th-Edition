The arginine pathway you determined for <i>Neurospora</i> is also present in humans as part of the urea cycle. The urea cycle is responsible for the breakdown of excess ammonia in humans. Disruptions of this cycle can lead to neurological dysfunction and death due to a buildup of ammonia. There are several lethal, genetically based enzyme deficiencies in humans that occur along this pathway. <p>
The graphs to the left show the results of newborn metabolic screens from individuals with three of these diseases: citrullinemia, argininosuccinic aciduria, and ornithine transcarbamylase  (OTC) deficiency.  The graphs show the buildup and breakdown of reaction products during the metabolic process. Each colored line on a graph corresponds to the change in concentration over time of one of the reaction products along the pathway. Use the data to determine the enzyme that catalyzes each step along the reaction pathway. Select the appropriate enzyme name from the menu box. To confirm your results, click on Check Answer.  To learn more about these diseases, click on each disease name. <p>
When you have checked your results, click on the Questions window and answer Questions 1 to 5.
