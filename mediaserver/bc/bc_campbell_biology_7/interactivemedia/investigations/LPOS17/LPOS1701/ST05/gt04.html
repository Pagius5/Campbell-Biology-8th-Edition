Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is a lethal, urea-cycle disorder caused by a genetic defect that results in a deficiency of the enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase.  The disorder occurs in about 1 out of every 30,000 children. In males, the onset of symptoms starts shortly after birth. In females, the symptoms may not appear until later in childhood. Affected newborns may lapse into a coma and die shortly after birth. Other children may experience extreme lethargy and coma, persistent vomiting, poor feeding, and hyperventilation. Frequent attacks can lead to mental retardation and developmental delays. The disorder may be controlled, but not cured, with a high-calorie, restricted-protein diet supplemented with citrulline. Dialysis may also be necessary to convert nitrogen to an excretable compound. Both prenatal and newborn screens are available, and there is a good prognosis if the disorder is detected and treated before the onset of symptoms.
