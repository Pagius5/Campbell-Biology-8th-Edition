Citrullinemia is a lethal, urea-cycle disorder caused by a genetic defect that results in a deficiency of the enzyme argininosuccinate synthase.  The disorder occurs in about 1 out of every 60,000 newborns. In severe forms, most affected newborns lapse into a coma and die shortly after birth. In milder forms, newborns may experience extreme lethargy and coma, persistent vomiting, poor feeding, and hyperventilation. Frequent attacks can lead to mental retardation and developmental delays. Milder forms may be controlled, but not cured, with a high-calorie, restricted-protein diet supplemented with arginine. Dialysis may also be necessary to convert nitrogen to an excretable compound. Both prenatal and newborn screens are available; and there is a good prognosis if the disorder is detected and treated before the onset of symptoms.
