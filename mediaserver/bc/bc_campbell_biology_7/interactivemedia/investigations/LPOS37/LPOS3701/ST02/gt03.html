This behavior distinguishes Mg<sup>2+</sup> deficiency from Fe<sup>3+</sup> deficiency. Both minerals are needed to make green leaves; Mg<sup>2+</sup> is part of the green chlorophyll molecule, and plants need Fe<sup>3+</sup> to put Mg<sup>2+</sup> into chlorophyll. But the two ions differ in mobility. Young leaves can take Mg<sup>2+</sup>, but not Fe<sup>3+</sup>, from old leaves. Thus, if the soil lacks Fe<sup>3+</sup>, the old leaves stay green while the young leaves grow yellow. If the soil lacks Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the old leaves turn yellow as they give up Mg<sup>2+</sup> to make the young leaves green.
