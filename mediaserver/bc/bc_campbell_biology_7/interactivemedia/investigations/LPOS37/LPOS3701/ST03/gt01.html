Air pollution can cause acid precipitation, in which raindrops carry H<sup>+</sup> into the soil. Acid precipitation makes soil less fertile. Here you will conduct an experiment to observe effects of acid precipitation on mineral deficiency.<p>
12 healthy plants are used in this experiment. The top 4 are control plants that have just been watered with regular rainwater. Click on the water bucket to water the other 8 plants with acid precipitation rainwater.
