Stage three of the hypothesis is the origin of self-replicating molecules. Biologists believed that clay encouraged molecules to collect into small units of metabolism capable of homeostasis. They also believed that these units replicated many of the molecules that carried out the metabolism.<p>
In this stage, even larger <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('polymers.html');return false;">polymers</a> are being created in the chamber. Together, the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('proteins.html');return false;">proteins</a> create self-maintaining metabolism. It is possible to get a diverse group of proteins that can carry out many different types of chemical reactions. The oligonucleotides found in the experiment are the building blocks for genetic material and, like proteins, can carry out chemical reactions.<p>
