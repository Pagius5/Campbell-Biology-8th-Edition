Biologists have evidence that life originated in the seas of the newly formed Earth about 3.5 billion years ago. The Earth was a very different place at that time. There were many volcanoes and violent storms. The atmosphere would be unbearable to most of the life found on Earth today. It had little, if any, oxygen and was rich in ammonia, hydrogen, and methane. The warm oceans were filled with fresh water. A steady rain of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('molecules.html');return false;">molecules</a> from the atmosphere turned the oceans into a soup of simple and complex molecules.<p>
In the 1920s scientists proposed that these conditions on the early Earth were responsible for creating life. Later, in 1953, Stanley Miller developed an experiment to test this hypothesis. The Miller experiment was a classic study that modeled the conditions believed to be present on Earth about 4 billion years ago. While it is not currently possible to create life from inorganic chemicals in the laboratory, it is possible to investigate the feasibility of life originating under the conditions of the early Earth.<p>
