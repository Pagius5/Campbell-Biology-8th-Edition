To simulate the hypothesized conditions of early Earth, Miller's experiment included a large electrical discharge in the upper chamber, cooling just below the upper chamber, and heating of the lower chamber. When the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('molecules.html');return false;">molecules</a> in the upper chamber are subjected to electricity, which mimics a lightning bolt, they rain down from the upper to the lower chamber. Note that this represents a short reaction time compared with the hundreds of millions of years in which life was forming.<p>
4. Click on the lower chamber of the experiment apparatus to collect a sample of the molecules.
