As in the first run of the experiment, a series of new molecules is created.<p>
7. Again, record these new molecules in your Lab Notebook using the data table.  Identify any molecules that match those associated with glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or cell structure. <p>
The molecules created in the first run of the experiment are also present. Many of these molecules play important roles in the structure and function of living organisms. For example, alanine is one of the building blocks of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('proteins.html');return false;">proteins</a>. Glycine and lactic acid can be used to produce fats and other complex organic molecules.<p>
8. Click on Run Experiment to continue the experiment one more time and see some other molecules that can be created.
