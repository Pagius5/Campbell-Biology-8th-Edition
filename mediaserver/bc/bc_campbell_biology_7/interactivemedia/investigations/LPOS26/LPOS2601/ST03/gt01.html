In this part of the experiment, you will create the conditions that lead to stage two of the four-stage hypothesis for the origin of life: the abiotic synthesis of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('polymers.html');return false;">polymers</a>. Polymers are large <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('molecules.html');return false;">molecules</a> made of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('monomers.html');return false;">monomers</a> (smaller molecules) bonded together. Polymers are useful for the structure and function of organisms. Researchers hypothesized that the molecules produced in the first stage reacted with clay particles suspended in the oceans. The clay acted as a binding agent that brought the molecules together to create polymers.<p>
