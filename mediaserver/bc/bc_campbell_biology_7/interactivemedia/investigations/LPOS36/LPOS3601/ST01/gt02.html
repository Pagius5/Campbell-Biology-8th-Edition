When water enters the roots, hydrogen bonds link each water molecule to the next so the molecules of water are pulled up the thin xylem vessels like beads on a string. The water moves up the plant, enters the leaves, moves into air spaces in the leaf, and then evaporates (transpires) through the stomata (singular, stoma).
