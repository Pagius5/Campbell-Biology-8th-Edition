The rate of transpiration is measured as the amount of water lost/square meter/minute. Because water evaporates through the many stomata on the leaf surface, the rate is directly related to the surface area. Arriving at the rate of transpiration, therefore, involves calculating the leaf surface area of each plant. Because most stomata are found in the lower epidermis, the surface area is calculated there.<p>
Leaves are measured by tracing their outlines on a 1-cm grid and counting the number of square centimeters, not including the petiole. A partial square is counted if it is at least half covered by the leaf, as shown in the example.<p>
The table at the left shows data collected for four experimental conditions. Click on the Lab Notebook window and use the data to practice calculating water loss and rate of transpiration, recording the results in the Lab Notebook. Then click on the Questions window and answer Questions 1 and 2.
