There are hundreds of stomata in the epidermis of a leaf. Most are located in the lower epidermis. This reduces water loss because the lower surface receives less solar radiation than the upper surface. Each stoma allows the carbon dioxide necessary for photosynthesis to enter, while water evaporates through each stoma in transpiration.
