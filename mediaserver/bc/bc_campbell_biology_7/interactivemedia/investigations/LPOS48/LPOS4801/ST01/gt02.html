In this experiment, you will be investigating electical stimulation. Note that a sciatic <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('nerve.html');return false;">nerve</a> from a frog has been placed into the nerve chamber.  Leads go from the stimulator output to the nerve chamber.  Leads also go from the nerve chamber to the oscilloscope.  Notice that these leads are red and black.  The stimulus travels along the red lead to the nerve.  When the nerve depolarizes, it will generate an electrical impulse that will travel along the red wire to the oscilloscope, and back to the nerve along the black wire.<p>
1. Set the voltage at 1.0 V by clicking the (+) button next to the Voltage display. Click Single Stimulus. Do you see any kind of response on the oscilloscope screen? If you saw no response, or a flat line indicating no action potential, click the Clear button on the oscilloscope, increase the voltage, and click Single Stimulus again until you see a trace (deflection of the line) that indicates an action potential.<p>
Click Record Data on the data collection box to record your results. Then click on the Questions window and answer Question 1.<p>
2. Increase the voltage by 0.5 V and click Single Stimulus. Click Record Data and answer Question 2.<p>
3. Continue to increase the voltage by 0.5 V and click Single Stimulus until you find the point beyond which no further increase occurs in the peak of the action potential trace. Click Record Data and answer Question 3.<p>
Now that you have seen that an electrical impulse can cause an action potential, click the Mechanical button at the top of the oscilloscope to try another method of stimulating a nerve.
