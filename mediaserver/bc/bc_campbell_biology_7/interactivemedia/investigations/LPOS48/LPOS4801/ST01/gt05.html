1. Click and drag the dropper from the bottle of sodium chloride (salt solution) over to the nerve in the chamber and then release the mouse button to dispense drops.  Does this generate an action potential?<p>Using the threshold voltage, which you determined when answering Question 1, stimulate the nerve with a single stimulus. Click Record Data to record your results. Now answer Question 6.<p>
2. Click the Clean button on top of the nerve chamber. This will return the nerve to its original (non-salted) state.  Click Clear to clear the oscilloscope screen. Click and drag the dropper from the bottle of hydrochloric acid and drag it over the nerve, and release the mouse button to dispense drops.  Does this generate an action potential? Answer Question 7.
