Nerves can be stimulated by chemicals, touch, or electric shock. Here you will investigate all these various stimuli. In order to study nerve physiology, you will use a frog nerve and several electronic instruments. The first instrument you will use is the electronic stimulator. The electronic stimulator administers an electric shock that is pure DC, and allows duration, frequency, and voltage of the shock to be precisely controlled.<p>
The second instrument is the oscilloscope, an instrument that measures voltage changes over a period of time. The face of the oscilloscope is similar to a computer screen. When you apply a stimulus to a nerve, the oscilloscope screen will display one of the following three results: no response, a flat line, or a graph with a peak.  A graph with a peak indicates that an <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('actionpotential.html');return false;">action potential</a> has been generated.<p>
While performing the following experiments, keep in mind that you are working with a nerve, which consists of many <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('neurons.html');return false;">neurons</a>. You are not just working with a single neuron.  The action potential you will see on the oscilloscope screen reflects the cumulative action potentials of all the neurons in the nerve, called a compound nerve action potential.<p>
To begin with the first set of experiments, click on the Electrical button at the top of the oscilloscope.
