In this activity, you will study the relationship between temperature and metabolic activity in an ectothermic animal, the water "flea" <i>Daphnia magna</i>. An ectotherm is an animal whose body temperature is much the same as its surroundings, such as a frog, a cricket, or a snake.<p>
Since ectotherms' temperature remains close to that of their environment, they face special challenges in thermoregulation, the maintenance of internal temperatures within a range that allows cells to function. Ectotherms exhibit a variety of behaviors that allow them to gain or lose heat. Examples include basking in the sun and burrowing in mud. Since metabolic rate increases with increasing temperature, ectotherms do not become active until their body has absorbed heat and warmed up. This accounts for the sluggish early morning behavior of ectotherms such as snakes.
