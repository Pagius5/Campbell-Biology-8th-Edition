The rate of metabolism in ectothermic animals increases as the environmental temperature increases. This rise occurs because the reactants in the cell have greater thermal energy, and many cellular enzymes are more active as temperature increases. This effect is noticeable in a range from approximately 5&deg; C to 35&deg;C; at temperatures much higher than this, enzymes become denatured.<p>
It is possible to measure metabolic rate indirectly by measuring heart rate. In this activity, you will gauge the effect of temperature on metabolic rate by counting the heartbeats of <i>Daphnia</i>. Click on the magnifying glass to conduct an experiment at 10&deg;C.
