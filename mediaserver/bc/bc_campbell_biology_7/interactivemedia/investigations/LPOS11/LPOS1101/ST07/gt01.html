Chromatography is interpreted by measuring the time it takes a particular chemical to travel through a special column of separation material under prescribed conditions. The travel time is compared with known <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('molecules.html');return false;">molecules</a> called standards.<p>
