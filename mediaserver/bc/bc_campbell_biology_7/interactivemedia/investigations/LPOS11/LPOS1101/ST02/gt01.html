You will be conducting a series of experiments on a special group of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cells.html');return false;">cells</a> to see how they communicate information in response to different environmental stimuli. Cells of a simple organism called a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cellularslimemold.html');return false;">cellular slime mold</a> will be used in this study. Slime molds, sponges, and other simple animals were traditionally used as model organisms for studying cell communication. They are still used today in many studies investigating the mechanisms of cell signaling.<p>
Before proceeding with the experiment, you will need to know something about the biology of cellular slime molds.<p>
Cellular slime molds are unusual creatures, spending much of their time living as a large collection of separate cells traveling in proximity. Each cell lives a solitary life feeding individually at this stage of the cellular slime mold life cycle.<p>
Certain environmental conditions stimulate the cells to come together into a tightly packed mass of cells. This mass of cells acts as one organism that then either undergoes <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('sexualreproduction.html');return false;">sexual reproduction</a> or forms into a dormant structure.  It is known that some type of cell communication is needed to cause the cells to form into a mass.<p>
Your mission is to investigate the type of cell communication used to bring the solitary cells together into an aggregated mass.
