Note the impact on the slime molds of reducing the water available to them. Their environment went from 60% humidity and wetness on the growing surface to 30% humidity and a dry growing surface.<p>
Observe the number of slime mold colonies that aggregated. We will be assuming that these are the average results of several trials. Then record your observations in the Lab Notebook at the bottom left of the screen.<p>
Click on the "Experiment Complete" button when you are done testing the environmental factors.
