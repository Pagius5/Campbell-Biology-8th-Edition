Before you look for the way <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cellularslimemold.html');return false;">cellular slime mold</a> <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cells.html');return false;">cells</a> communicate, you must find a way to measure whether the cells are communicating. One way to do this is by stimulating solitary cells to form an aggregated mass.<p>
However, first you must identify the environmental factor that causes the cells to come together. It is possible that more than one factor causes the slime mold cells to aggregate. You will be testing three hypothesized environmental factors.<p>
Click on "Temperature Change" to test its effect on aggregation.
