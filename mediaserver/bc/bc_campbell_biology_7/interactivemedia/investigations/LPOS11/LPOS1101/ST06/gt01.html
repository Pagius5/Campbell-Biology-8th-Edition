You now know that the aggregation <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('molecule.html');return false;">molecule</a> is a type of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('nucleotide.html');return false;">nucleotide</a>. However, it can be one or more of many nucleotides used in cell communication. Your next task is to perform an exact identification of the aggregation molecule.<p>
Liquid chromatography is one type of analytical method for determining the nature of a chemical. In this last part of the experiment you will place a sample of the aggregate molecule into the chromatography apparatus.  You will then compare it with a series of known nucleotides.
