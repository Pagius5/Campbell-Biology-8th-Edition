Proteases are <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('enzymes.html');return false;">enzymes</a> that digest proteins. Adding protease to a sample of the aggregation molecule would stop the molecule from working if it is a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('protein.html');return false;">protein</a>. In this part of the experiment you will add samples of solution collected from an aggregating slime mold. One sample is not treated with protease, whereas the other sample is treated with protease.<p>
Click and drag one of the pipettes to the petri plates to see the results of the experiment.
