Knowing that depleting food supply stimulates aggregation, it will be used as the factor to help you study <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cell.html');return false;">cell</a> communication in <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cellularslimemold.html');return false;">cellular slime molds</a>.<p>
In this part of the investigation you will be asked to determine the chemical nature of the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('molecule.html');return false;">molecule</a> used for cell communication in the cellular slime mold. It is acceptable to assume that the molecule is a substance secreted by the cells and is then transported from cell to cell through the soil. You will be using samples of an aggregation molecule collected from slime mold colonies deprived of food. You will also know to test suspected aggregation molecules on slime mold cells having enough available food to prevent them from aggregating naturally.<p>
Begin by performing different types of chemical tests to learn about the nature of the molecule causing aggregation.<p>
The most common types of molecules used in cell communication are <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('proteins.html');return false;">proteins</a> and <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('lipids.html');return false;">lipids</a>. Using simple methods, in this investigation you will determine if the molecule is a protein, a lipid, or neither a protein nor a lipid.<p>
Click on one of the test methods to see its effect on aggregation.
