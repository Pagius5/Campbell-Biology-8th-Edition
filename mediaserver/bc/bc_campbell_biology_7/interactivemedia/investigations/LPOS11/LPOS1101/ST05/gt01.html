Now you know the aggregation molecule is not a protein or a lipid. Other compounds that are commonly used in cell communication are <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('carbohydrates.html');return false;">carbohydrates</a> and <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('nucleotide.html');return false;">nucleotides</a>.  You will now conduct some tests to determine if the aggregation molecule is a carbohydrate or a nucleotide.<p>
To perform this experiment, you had to purify the sample of aggregation molecule to ensure it was not contaminated from chemicals used to grow the slime molds. This is done using a procedure called liquid chromatography. After purifying the sample, you tested some of it on a slime mold colony to ensure it still contained the aggregation molecule.<p>
Click on one of the test methods to investigate the chemical nature of the aggregation molecule.
