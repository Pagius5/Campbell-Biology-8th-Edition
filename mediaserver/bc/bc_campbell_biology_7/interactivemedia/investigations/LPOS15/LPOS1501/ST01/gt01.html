In this investigation, you will study the patterns by which physical characteristics are transmitted from generation to generation and use the chi-square test to help your analysis.<p>
By breeding fruit flies (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>) of unknown genetic composition and studying the traits and ratios seen in their offspring, you will determine whether a trait follows a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('monohybrid.html');return false;">monohybrid</a> or <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('dihybrid.html');return false;">dihybrid</a> pattern of inheritance and whether it is sex-linked or <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('autosomal.html');return false;">autosomal</a>. You will use statistical analysis to support your conclusions.<p>
We say that like comes from like, but offspring do not always look exactly like their parents. In the laboratory, you may breed two parent flies with red eyes and get some offspring with sepia (deep brown) eyes. How is this possible?<p>
In the nineteenth century, Gregor Mendel discovered the principles of inheritance through a series of careful experiments with peas. We know now that physical characteristics are transmitted from generation to generation according to some general patterns. When we have sufficient information about the parents, we can predict the occurrence of traits in offspring. And by analyzing the offspring, we can discern the mode of transmission &#151; monohybrid or dihybrid, <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('sexlinked.html');return false;">sex linked</a> or autosomal.
