Look at the tables from Case 1 again. From the data presented, you can deduce that the F<sub>1</sub> cross was between individuals <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('heterozygous.html');return false;">heterozygous</a> for eye color:<p>
+<i>se</i> x  +<i>se</i> (+ = red; <i>se</i> = sepia ). From this conclusion, you could write the following hypothesis: "If the parents are heterozygous for eye color, there will be a 3:1 ratio of red eyes to sepia eyes in the offspring." Do your results support this hypothesis?<p>The actual results of an experiment are unlikely to match the expected results precisely. But how great a variance is significant? One way to decide is to use the chi-square (x<sup>2</sup>) test.  This analytical tool tests the validity of a null hypothesis, which states that there is no statistically significant difference between the observed results of your experiment and the expected results. When there is little difference between the observed results and the expected results, you obtain a very low chi-square value; your hypothesis is supported.<p>
How do you calculate the expected value? In a cross between two heterozygous individuals, the offspring would be expected to show a 3 : 1 ratio. For example, in Case 1, three-fourths of the individuals would have red (wild-type) eyes, and one-fourth would have sepia eyes. If there are 44 offspring, how many are expected to have red eyes? We expect three-fourths to have red eyes. So three-fourths of 44 is 33. If there are 44 offspring, how many are expected to have sepia eyes?<br>
One-fourth of 44 is 11.<br>
Now you are ready to calculate chi-square.
