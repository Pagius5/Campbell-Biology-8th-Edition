The chi-square critical values table provides two values:<p>
Degrees of freedom. This number is one less than the total number of classes of offspring in a cross. In a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('monohybrid.html');return false;">monohybrid</a> cross, such as our Case 1, there are two classes of offspring (red eyes and sepia eyes). Therefore, there is just one degree of freedom. In a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('dihybrid.html');return false;">dihybrid</a> cross, there are four possible classes of offspring, so there are three degrees of freedom.<p>
Probability. The probability value (p) is the probability that a deviation as great as or greater than each chi-square value would occur simply by chance. Many biologists agree that deviations having a chance probability greater than 0.05 (5%) are not statistically significant. <p>
Use the critical values table here to answer Questions 7 and 8.
