The first thing you must do in this investigation is to learn to distinguish male fruit flies from female fruit flies. Female flies generally have a long, pointed, lightly striped abdomen. The male abdomen, by contrast, is blunt and darker. Very young flies may not show this clear difference, so for more certain sex identification you should look for sex combs, dark bristles found on the inner surface of the forelimbs. Only males have sex combs.
