The traditional phylogenetic tree of the invertebrates was developed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries using anatomical features, especially those relating to the body plan.  Unique <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('sharedderivedcharacter.html');return false;">shared derived characteristics</a> were used to group animals into phyla and larger groups.  For example, all animals with bilateral symmetry are grouped into the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('bilateria.html');return false;">Bilateria</a>; it is assumed that these animals all shared a common ancestor that evolved bilateral symmetry and three body layers.<p>
New molecular research in the last ten years has forced a re-evaluation of the traditional phylogenetic tree.  Before you learn about this research, it would be useful to review the anatomical and developmental features for each of the phyla.  Identify the features of each phylum presented at the left, and check off the features in the lab notebook chart if those features are present.  This will allow you to compare features between phyla.
