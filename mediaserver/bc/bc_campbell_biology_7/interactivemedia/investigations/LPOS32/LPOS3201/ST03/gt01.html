The 18S rRNA data have generally supported the clades developed using anatomical or developmental <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('sharedderivedcharacter.html');return false;">shared derived characters</a>. However, there are some discrepancies, suggesting that perhaps the wrong characteristics were considered significant shared derived characters in the traditional <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cladogram.html');return false;">cladogram</a>. Examine the groups.<p>
Click back and forth between the cladograms to determine which shared derived characters used to draw the traditional cladogram were "wiped out" by the 18S rRNA data.  Then answer Question 6.<p>
Review the 18S rRNA cladogram again.<p>
Evolutionary biologists studying the 18S rRNA data have re-examined the characteristics that the animal phyla have in common.  Using the chart in your lab notebook, identify shared derived characters that could be used to form the clades indicated in the 18S rRNA cladogram labeled as A, B, C, and D.  Answer Questions 7 and 8.
