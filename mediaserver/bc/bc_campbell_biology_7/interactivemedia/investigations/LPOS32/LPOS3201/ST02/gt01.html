A phylogenetic tree based on morphological comparisons is shown at the left.  Examine which phyla are grouped together and check your Lab Notebook for the key <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('sharedderivedcharacter.html');return false;">shared derived character</a> that links each subgroup together.  Then click on the Questions window and answer Questions 1-3.<p>
Ribosomes in animal cells, regardless of phylum, are nearly identical, especially with regard to the embedded strands of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('ribosomalrna.html');return false;">ribosomal RNA</a>.  Ribosomal RNA sequences are very highly conserved among invertebrate animals, especially the sequences of the 18S strand of rRNA.  Sequences that mutate infrequently are ideal for deriving phylogenetic relationships.  The more similar the sequences, the more closely related two animal phyla are.  Comparison of 18S rRNA between invertebrate phyla provides support for some of the traditional groupings but significantly rearranges others. Click the "Molecular (18S rRNA) <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cladogram.html');return false;">Cladogram</a>" button to view the phylogeny based on 18S rRNA data.
