Now that you've had a chance to tour the scale of our world and get familiar with the units of measurements used to size it, you're ready to do some sizing of your own.<p>
Each of the following images represents a biological object. Next to each image is a scale bar, with a label telling you how big a certain metric unit is. You will estimate sizes of the labeled objects in each of 10 images, and record your estimates in your Lab Notebook. Don't worry about precision; an approximate answer is all that's needed. In the Example image at left, how would you estimate the size of A, B, and C, given that the scale bar represents 10 &mu;m? Appropriate answers might be:<p>
A = &#732; 18 &mu;m diameter*<br>
B = &#732; 7 &mu;m diameter<br>
C = &#732; 1 &mu;m diameter<br>
<i>*The symbol</i> &#732; <i>means "about."</i><p>
When you make your estimates, make sure to include both a number and a unit of measurement. Simply answering "18" without specifying whether the unit of measurement is &mu;m, nm, or mm is incorrect.<p>
Remember that these estimates are "eyeball estimates" only. Biologists frequently make such estimates, and postpone making more detailed measurements until greater precision is called for. All the sizes in this activity can be eyeball estimates.<p>
