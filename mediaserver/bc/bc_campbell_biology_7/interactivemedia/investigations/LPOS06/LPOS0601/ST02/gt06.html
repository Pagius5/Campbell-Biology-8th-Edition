The TEM of picornaviruses at left was made by negative staining. Picornaviruses are so named because they have RNA as their genetic material and are extremely small (Greek pico means very small). These are among the most diverse virus groups (over 200 types are known) and their diseases are possibly the oldest documented (Egyptian temple hieroglyphs from ca. 1400 B.C.). They cause a variety of diseases, including the common cold (at least 50% of colds are caused by rhinovirus infections), poliomyelitis, and viral enteritis (infections of the intestinal tract).<p>
