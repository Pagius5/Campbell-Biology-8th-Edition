The two images at left are digitized, three-dimensional reconstructions of neurons (nerve cells) originally photographed with an intermediate high- voltage microscope.<br><br>Both images show the cell bodies of neurons. Dendrites and axons, which normally branch out of neurons in great numbers, have been removed in these images. The following color codes were used in these figures:<br><br>-- Purple = nucleus<br>-- Blue = nucleolus<br>-- White = Golgi apparatus<br>-- Translucent white = cell surface<br>-- Orange = paired helical filaments in diseased cell<br><br>One cell is from a patient with Alzheimer's disease; the other is from a healthy adult. Alzheimer's disease is one of the more common afflictions of the elderly, and it is characterized by a progressive loss of higher mental functions and memory. The cause of Alzheimer's disease is still unclear. Electron microscope studies such as this may contribute to understanding the cellular basis for the disease.<br><br>27. Estimate the sizes of the following and record your estimates in your Lab Notebook:<br><br>-- the cell body of a neuron<br>-- the nucleus of a neuron<br>-- the nucleolus of a neuron<br><br>28.
