This is the size range for typical eukaryotic cells, such as most of our body cells. The scanning electron micrograph to the left shows a human macrophage (gray) approaching a chain of <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> bacteria (yellow). Riding atop the macrophage is a spherical lymphocyte (pink). Both macrophages and lymphocytes can be found near an infection, and the interaction between these cells is important in eliminating infection.<br><br>Notice the size range of the cells in this image. Macrophages range from 15 to 25 µm, while many bacteria are 0.5-2 µm. These images have been colorized; electron microscope images have no inherent color.<br><br>15. Click on the 1 µm button.
