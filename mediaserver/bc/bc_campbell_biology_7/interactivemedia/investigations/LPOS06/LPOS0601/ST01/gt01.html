Kilometers, meters, micrometers, Angstroms, etc. -- these are the units of the metric system, and of all scientific  measurement.<br><br>First you will take a "hyperspace tour" and explore a range of sizes, from the size of planet Earth down to the size of an atom. Each stop on this tour will appear in an image at left and differs from the stop before and after it by a multiplication or reduction factor of 10. Each image contains a ruler with a metric unit assigned to it.<br><br>The sizes chosen for this tour, from 100,000 kilometers to 1 Angstrom, in no way exhaust the range of physical objects: astronomical objects are much larger, and subatomic objects are much smaller, than the size units discussed here.<br><br>1. To begin, click the 100,000  km button at left.
