We are now at the size range of large molecules. 10 nm is just 100 times larger than the diameter of a small atom.<br><br>The figure to the left illustrates hemoglobin, a large protein found in red blood cells. Hemoglobin carries oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and distributes them throughout the tissues of an animal's body.<br><br>There are several ways to represent hemoglobin in models. The figure shown to the left uses balls to represent atoms and sticks to represent the covalent bonds between atoms. Each element is colored differently:<br><br>-- White = carbon<br>-- Blue = nitrogen<br>-- Red = oxygen<br>-- Yellow = sulfur<br><br>18. Click on the 1 nm button.
