We are now at the scale of 1 mm (about 1/32 of an inch).<br><br>We are close to the limits of human vision. Any optical instrument has a limiting resolving power -- the smallest object that can be clearly distinguished. The resolving power of the human eye is 0.2 mm, just 1/5 of the size bar at our current scale. For this scale and smaller, we need to be able to resolve objects.<br><br>The image at left shows a nematode, a common microscopic animal. Nematodes are simple worms, with an outer skin and a long digestive tube. They typically range from 400 µm to several mm in size. The longest nematode ever found was 8 feet long!<br><br>Nematodes are amazingly abundant. In 1914, Nathan Cobb made the following observation:<br><br>If all the matter in the universe except nematodes were swept away, our world would still be recognizable, and if, as disembodied spirits, we could then investigate it, we should find its mountains, hills, vales, rivers, lakes, and oceans represented by a film of nematodes. The location of towns would be decipherable, since for every massing of human beings there would be a corresponding massing of certain nematodes. Trees would still stand in ghostly rows representing our streets and highways. The location of the various plants and animals would still be decipherable, and had we sufficient knowledge, in many cases even their species could be determined by an examination of their erstwhile nematode parasites.<br><br>Many nematodes feed on soil bacteria, fungi, and other organisms. Some are parasitic, including species that cause heartworm in dogs and pinworm in humans. Other species are parasitic on plants, leading to millions of dollars in lost crops.<br><br>13.
