This is the size range for typical viruses. Viruses are not cells &#151; they lack the internal structures and energy-generating mechanisms characteristic of cells. They are inert packages of parasitic DNA and RNA, migrating from cell to cell with instructions that allow those cells to become factories for virus manufacture.<br><br>The illustration to the left is a computer-generated image of a rhinovirus. Different protein molecules on the virus coat are colored differently. Rhinoviruses are responsible for about 50% of cases of the common cold. Every time you catch a cold, you soon develop immunity to that virus. You keep getting colds, not because your immunity fails, but because there are so many species of rhinoviruses (well over 100 recognized types, differing in their surface proteins).<br><br>Rhinoviruses are among the smallest viruses, only about 30 nm in diameter. Some poxviruses, such as smallpox and vaccinia virus, are 10 times larger than this virus, reaching dimensions of about 300 nm.<br><br>17. Click on the 10 nm button.
