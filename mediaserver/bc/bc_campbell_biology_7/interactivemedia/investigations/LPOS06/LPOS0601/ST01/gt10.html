We are now at the scale of 1 m (39.37 inches, just over 3 feet). Most familiar animals and plants other than large trees are in this size range.<br><br>The brown bears shown at left have a body length of 1-2 m. Adults weigh 150-375 kilograms (330-825 pounds).<br><br>The population of brown bears in the lower 48 United States has declined to fewer than 1000 bears; populations in Alaska and northern Canada are estimated currently to be somewhat less than 50,000. Another 100,000 brown bears are estimated to live in the coniferous forests of northern Russia.<br><br>Brown bears are voracious eaters. An adult will eat up to 40 kg (about 90 lb) of food each day in summer and early fall, and may gain over 2 kg (up to 5 lb) in body mass per day. They will eat anything edible, and over 75% of their food consists of plant materials such as grasses, berries, tubers, roots, and nuts. The remainder of their diet consists of fish, ants, honey, small animals such as squirrels, and decaying animal carcasses.<br><br>When cold weather arrives, their metabolism changes drastically as they prepare for hibernation. A hibernating bear's heart rate drops to as low as 8 beats per minute (contrasted with 40-70 beats/minute for active bears). Bears lose 15-30% of their weight while hibernating, and cubs may lose as much as 40%.<br><br>10. Click on the 100 mm button.
