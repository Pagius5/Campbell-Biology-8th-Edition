We are now at the size range of large biological molecules, such as the DNA molecule shown to the left. DNA, the molecule responsible for heredity, has a diameter of about 2 nm, only 20 times the diameter of a single atom. DNA molecules are very long, however. The DNA from the intestinal bacterium <i>E. coli</i>, for example, is 1 mm in actual length. Such a piece of DNA would stretch 1 million times the length of the ruler on this page.<br><br>In this model, each DNA atom is represented as a colored ball, with the following color code:<br><br>-- Black = carbon<br>-- Blue = nitrogen<br>-- Red = oxygen<br>-- White = hydrogen<br>-- Green = phosphorus<br><br>19.
