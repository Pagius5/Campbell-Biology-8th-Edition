This is the largest scale at which we find individual living organisms. Trees are the largest living organisms, and among trees, the giant sequoias are the largest of all. Coastal redwoods are taller, but not as massive.<br><br>Sequoias grow only on the west slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The General Sherman tree, in Sequoia National Park, may be the single most massive living organism, towering over 83 m (275 ft), with a diameter of 11 m (36 ft). Such trees are over 3000 years old.<br><br>Groves of Sequoias produce up to eight times more biomass than a mature tropical rain forest. One mature tree can produce enough lumber to build 22 houses.<br><br>Sequoias don't die of old age. John Muir wrote: "Most of the Sierra trees die of disease, fungi, etc., but nothing hurts the Big Tree. Barring accidents, it seems to be immortal." He was partially right. The trees resist insects and fungi well, due to chemicals in their bark and wood. A major cause of death is toppling to the ground, because their shallow root systems fail to anchor them well. More often, the chain saw and the demands of the lumber industry bring death to these forest giants.<br><br>8. Click on the 10 m button.
