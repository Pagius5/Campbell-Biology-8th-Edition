In a population at equilibrium, mating must be random. In assortative mating, individuals tend to choose mates similar to themselves; for example, large blister beetles tend to choose mates of large size, and small blister beetles tend to choose small mates. Though this does not alter allelic frequencies, it results in fewer heterozygous individuals than you would expect in a population where mating is random.
