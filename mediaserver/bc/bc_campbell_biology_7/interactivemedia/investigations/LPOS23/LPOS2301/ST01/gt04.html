For a population to be at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, there can be no change in allelic frequency due to mutation. Any mutation in a particular gene would change the balance of alleles in the gene pool. Mutations may remain hidden in large populations for a number of generations, but may show more quickly in a small population.
