The Hardy-Weinberg law of genetic equilibrium provides a mathematical model for                          studying evolutionary changes in allelic frequency within a population. In 1908 G. Hardy and W. Weinberg independently proposed that the frequency of alleles and genotypes in a population will remain constant from generation to generation if the population is stable and in genetic equilibrium. Five conditions are required in order for a population to remain at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.  Click on each condition to see how it functions to maintain genetic equilibrium and how the opposite condition can bring about a change in the gene pool.
