In a population at equilibrium, no alleles are selected over other alleles. If selection occurs, those alleles that are selected for will become more common. For example, if resistance to a particular herbicide allows weeds to live in an environment that has been sprayed with that herbicide, the allele for resistance may become more frequent in the population.
