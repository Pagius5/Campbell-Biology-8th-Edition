A large breeding population helps to ensure that chance alone does not disrupt genetic equilibrium. In a small population, only a few copies of a certain allele may exist. If for some chance reason the organisms with that allele do not reproduce successfully, the allelic frequency will change. This random, nonselective change is what happens in genetic drift or a bottleneck event.
