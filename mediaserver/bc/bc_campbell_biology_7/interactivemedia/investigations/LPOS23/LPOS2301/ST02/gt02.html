In this population of pigs at equilibrium, the allele for black coat is recessive. Use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to determine the percent of the pig population that is heterozygous for white coat. Click on the Lab Notebook window and use the Lab Notebook to record your calculations. <p>
1. Calculate <i>q</i><sup>2</sup>.<p>
Count the individuals that are homozygous recessive in the illustration at left. Calculate the percent of the total population they represent. This is <i>q</i><sup>2</sup>.<p>
2. Find <i>q</i>.<p>
Take the square root of <i>q</i><sup>2</sup> to obtain <i>q</i>, the frequency of the recessive allele.<p>
3. Find <i>p</i>.<p>
The sum of frequency of both alleles = 100%, <i>p</i>+<i>q</i> = 1. You know <i>q</i>, so what is <i>p</i>, the frequency of the dominant allele?<p>4. Find 2<i>pq</i>.<p>
The frequency of the heterozygotes is represented by 2<i>pq</i>. This gives you the percent of the population that is heterozygous for white coat.<p>
Now click on the Questions window and use the data from the Lab Notebook to answer Question 1. Then click on Problem 2.
