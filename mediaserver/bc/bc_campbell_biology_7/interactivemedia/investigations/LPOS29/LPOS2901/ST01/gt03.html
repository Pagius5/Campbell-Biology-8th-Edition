This is a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('sporangium.html');return false;">sporangium</a> from a maidenhair fern, <i>Adiantum capillis-veneris</i>. The stalk is at the bottom, and the annulus (a raised ridge of cells in the sporangial wall) runs around the left side of the sporangium. The lip cells, the weak spot where the mature sporangial wall will split, are on the right. The tissue just under the sporangial wall is the tapetum, the nutritive layer found in the sporangia of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('vascularplants.html');return false;">vascular plants</a>. The irregular mass of round cells in the middle of the sporangium is the spore-producing tissue made up of the round sporocytes (spore mother cells). Some of them look like they are beginning to cleave, suggesting this picture was taken as the sporocytes were undergoing <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('meiosis.html');return false;">meiosis</a>.
