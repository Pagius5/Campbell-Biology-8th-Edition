Here is a mature <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('sporangium.html');return false;">sporangium</a> of a maidenhair fern. The <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('spores.html');return false;">spores</a> are mature and brown. The tapetum has broken down. The annulus has begun to contract, and the lip cells have been pulled apart. On the fern, the sporangium would be torn open and held together only by the annulus. A cup formed by the sporangial wall would hold the spores. Then the annulus would rebound, shooting the spores off into the air.
