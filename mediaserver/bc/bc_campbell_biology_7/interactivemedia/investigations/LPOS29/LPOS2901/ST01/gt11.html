This a single sorus of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('sporangia.html');return false;">sporangia</a> on the underside of a leaf of holly fern.  The sorus consists of numerous sporangia, and it is covered by an umbrella-like indusium.  The stalks of the individual sporangia radiate from the central axis of the indusium.  As the sporangia mature, the indusium dries out, exposing the sporangia allowing them to release their <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('spores.html');return false;">spores</a>. (Each sporangium contains a few dozen spores.)  The individual sporangia seen here look like little green to brown balls.  The greener sporangia are younger and the browner ones are more mature.
