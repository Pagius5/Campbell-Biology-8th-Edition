Sorry, this is the wrong design. You are testing the hypothesis that <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('acidprecipitation.html');return false;">acid precipitation</a> damages the leaves of young trees. You are therefore looking for the effect of acid precipitation (as opposed to normal precipitation) on leaves. Without comparing acidic water (<a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('ph.html');return false;">pH</a> 4.5) to normal rainwater water (pH 5.6), you cannot determine whether acid precipitation has an effect on the trees (for instance, if all the trees show damage to some degree). You are testing the effect of the degree of acidity (4.5 versus 5) as it relates to the number of damaged leaves. You may find that if you have acid precipitation, higher acidity is more damaging to the trees than a lower acidity. You may not know, however, how damaging normal precipitation will be to the trees.<p>
Try another experimental design.
