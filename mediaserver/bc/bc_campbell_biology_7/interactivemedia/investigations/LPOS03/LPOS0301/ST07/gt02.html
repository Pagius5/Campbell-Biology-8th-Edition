Incorrect. This design won't work. If you water all of your 100 trees with acidic water at <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('ph.html');return false;">pH</a> 4.5, you cannot be sure that your treatment of acidic water is the effect you are testing. If your results showed that most trees have few leaves, then this finding may or may not be the result of the acidic water. It could be the result of many other factors. For example, all of the trees may have been exposed to insects that ate most of their leaves, or the pots may have been too small for adequate root growth, thereby stunting tree (and leaf) growth.<p>
Try another experimental design.
