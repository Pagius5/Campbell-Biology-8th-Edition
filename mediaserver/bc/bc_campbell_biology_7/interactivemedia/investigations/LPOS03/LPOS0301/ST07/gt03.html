Correct! Good design. By giving half the trees acidic water and half normal water, you have adequately controlled your experiment, making sure that there is only one variable that differs between the experimental group (those trees receiving acidic water) and the control group (those trees receiving normal water). Thus, if there is variation between the trees watered with acidic and normal water, you can attribute this effect to the acidic water rather than some other unknown cause.<p>
