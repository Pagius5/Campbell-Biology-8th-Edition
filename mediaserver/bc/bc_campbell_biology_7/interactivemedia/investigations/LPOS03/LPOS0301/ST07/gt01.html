Now you can set up an experiment to test your hypothesis. You start by placing 100 one-year-old red oaks in one-gallon pots, with equal amounts of soil in each. Once a month for a year, you will measure the total number of leaves and the percentage of damaged leaves found on each tree.<p>
Which of the following experiments would be most appropriate to test the hypothesis that <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('acidprecipitation.html');return false;">acid precipitation</a> damages the leaves of young red oak trees?<p>(1) You water each tree daily with 100 ml of water, giving all 100 trees acidic water with a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('ph.html');return false;">pH</a> of 4.5.<p>
(2) You water each tree daily with 100 ml of water, giving 50 trees acidic water with a pH of 4.5 and 50 trees "normal" water with a pH of 5.6.<p>
(3) You water each tree daily with 100 ml of water, giving 50 trees acidic water with a pH of 4.5 and 50 trees acidic water with a pH of 5.<p>
Click on what you think is the best experiment.
