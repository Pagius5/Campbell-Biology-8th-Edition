Good. You decide to test the hypothesis that <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('acidprecipitation.html');return false;">acid precipitation</a> directly damages the leaves of young trees&#8212; specifically, one-year-old red oak trees. Red oaks are common trees found in many eastern forests. If the leaves of these young trees are damaged, then they may not be able to grow rapidly, since plants produce energy in their leaves through the process of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('photosynthesis.html');return false;">photosynthesis</a>. With sufficient damage to their leaves, the trees may even die. If the leaves of the young red oaks are damaged, then the forest as a whole may be affected.<p>
