These maps show the average <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('ph.html');return false;">pH</a> of annual precipitation in the U.S. in 1955 and 1990. Click on the button to compare maps. The numbers next to the black lines and the color code refer to pH. Precipitation was more acidic in the colored areas than in the black and gray areas. Precipitation was most acidic in the lightest green areas. Note how in some areas acidity increased (pH has decreased) dramatically.  Use this observation to answer Question 7. Then click on "Which areas in North America are sensitive to acid precipitation?"
