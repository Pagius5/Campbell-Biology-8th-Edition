<a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('acidprecipitation.html');return false;">Acid precipitation</a> results mainly from sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that react with water in the air to form sulfuric and nitric acids.

Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are mainly the result of fossil fuel burning in coal-burning electric power plants (the single largest source of acid pollutants), factories, and automobiles.<p>
