Incorrect. You may find that some of the dying forests are found in areas with the lowest <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('ph.html');return false;">pH</a>. But you may also find some healthy forests in areas of the lowest pH (if these forests are able to <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('buffer.html');return false;">buffer</a>, or "neutralize," the effect of the acidity) or none of your forests are in areas of low pH (you may never have visited these areas).
