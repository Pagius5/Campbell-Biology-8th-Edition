Good choice. By comparing the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('ph.html');return false;">pH</a> of areas where you observed dying forests to the pH of thriving areas, you may get a good head start in determining whether <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('acidprecipitation.html');return false;">acid precipitation</a> is a potential cause for the destruction of forests.<p>
The pH values of dying forests were lower. It is important to understand, though, that this evidence does not rule out other variables that may be responsible for your observations. However, with your additional information, it is worthwhile to perform an experiment to test the effect of acid precipitation on forest ecosystems.<p>
Before you perform the experiment, click Next to pose a testable hypothesis.
