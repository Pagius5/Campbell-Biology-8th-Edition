To analyze the DNA density, the samples are mixed with cesium chloride and spun in an ultracentrifuge. If the DNA molecules in a sample are of the same density, the result is a single band of DNA. If the molecules have two different densities, the result is two bands of DNA. The positioning of each band indicates the density. A band with light density, for example, will appear near the top of the tube. Click on the ultracentrifuge to see a simulation of the formation of bands of DNA.
