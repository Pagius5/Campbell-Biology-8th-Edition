After Watson and Crick proposed the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('doublehelix.html');return false;">double helix</a> structure for DNA, three models for DNA replication were proposed: conservative, semiconservative, and dispersive.<p>
In the conservative model, the first replication produces one daughter molecule containing both parental strands and another containing all new strands.<p>
In the semiconservative model, each parental strand is a template for a new strand. Each daughter molecule has a parental strand and a new strand.<p>
In the dispersive model, each parental strand is broken into double-stranded segments that act as templates for new molecules. The segments then reassemble into complete double helices, each with parental and new segments interspersed.<p>
Compare the models. Then click on the Questions window and answer Questions 1 and 2.
