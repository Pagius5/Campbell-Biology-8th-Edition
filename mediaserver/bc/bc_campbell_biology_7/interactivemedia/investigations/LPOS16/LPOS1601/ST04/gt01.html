Recall what each model predicted for replication cycle 1:<p>
Conservative: one daughter molecule has parental strands and one has new strands.<p>
Semiconservative: each daughter molecule has a parental strand and a new strand.<p>
Dispersive: each daughter molecule has parental and new segments interspersed.<p>
In this experiment, both tubes contain growth medium with the normal <sup>14</sup>N isotope. For the control tube, bacteria with the normal <sup>14</sup>N isotope are added. For the experimental tube, bacteria with the heavy <sup>15</sup>N isotope are added. Click on the ultracentrifuge to conduct the experiment for replication cycle 1. Observe the results and then answer Question 4.
