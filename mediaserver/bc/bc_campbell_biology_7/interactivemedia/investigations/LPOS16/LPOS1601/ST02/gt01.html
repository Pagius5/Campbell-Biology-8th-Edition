The three models predicted different distributions of parental and new DNA strands. Matthew Meselson and Frank Stahl developed a way to distinguish the strands, using a heavy <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('isotope.html');return false;">isotope</a> of nitrogen, <sup>15</sup>N. Replacing the normal <sup>14</sup>N isotope with <sup>15</sup>N produces heavier DNA. If the parental DNA contains <sup>15</sup>N and the new DNA contains <sup>14</sup>N, different combinations of parental and new DNA will have different densities.<p>
To label the DNA, Meselson and Stahl first cultured bacteria in a growth medium containing <sup>15</sup>N-labeled ammonium salt. All the DNA made in this medium contained the heavy <sup>15</sup>N. They then shifted the bacteria to a growth medium containing <sup>14</sup>N so that all new DNA made after the shift contained <sup>14</sup>N. Culture samples were taken at the time of the shift, after replication cycle 1, and after replication cycle 2.<p>
Answer Question 3.
