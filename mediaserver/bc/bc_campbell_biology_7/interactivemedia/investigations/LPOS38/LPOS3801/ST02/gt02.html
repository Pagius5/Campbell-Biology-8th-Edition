Two weeks after you saw the desert bloom, you have time to visit the old man. All the blooms are gone, leaving only dry stalks and seeds. The old man offers you a tin cup of coffee and warns you that tin cups get hot. Then you ask if he knows what made the desert bloom. He replies "Nope, I ain't got a clue. But I'll tell you this: it doesn't happen every year, and you'll only see it after a thunderstorm in August or September."  Then you ask, "How long after a rain does it take for the flowers to appear?"  He replies, "Takes about three weeks, and the bloom doesn't last but a week. There was a good storm in the next valley three weeks ago; what say we drive over and see it right now?"<p>
