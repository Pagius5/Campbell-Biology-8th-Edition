You learn that the yellow flowers you collected in the desert belong to the species <i>Pectis papposa</i>.  It's related to the daisy and is common throughout the American tropics and the southwestern deserts. What looks like a single flower is really a collection of many tiny flowers, each making one tiny seed. You can order seeds of <i>Pectis</i> from the herbarium, and you do so. You've decided to make <i>Pectis</i> your experimental plant.  Better write about it in your answer to Question 3 before you forget.
