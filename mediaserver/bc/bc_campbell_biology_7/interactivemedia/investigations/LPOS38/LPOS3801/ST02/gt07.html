A good library can save years of research, though it takes patience. If your college has electronic databases, you can search for articles on <i>Pectis papposa</i>, or desert seed germination. Recent articles may lead to older works that you only find with a trip to dusty bookshelves.  But it's worth the trouble!  You  find good leads in <i>Seed Germination in Desert Plants</i>, by Y. Gutterman, published by Springer-Verlag in 1993. It's mostly about Israel, but it mentions Went's studies on our <i>Pectis</i> in America. From Gutterman's book you get ideas about how plants like <i>Pectis</i> know when to germinate, but there's nothing conclusive about <i>Pectis</i> itself. You must do your own experiments!
