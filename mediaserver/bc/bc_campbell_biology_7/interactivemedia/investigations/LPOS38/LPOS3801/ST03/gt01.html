Now you know seeds of yellow-flowered <i>Pectis</i> need rainfall in hot weather to germinate. Your task is to explore the way rain calls for germination. The seeds you ordered have arrived, and the logical experiment is to plant them in pots and give them showers like rain, to see just what they need. You'll put 50 seeds each in 6 pots of washed sterile desert soil, give them a day-long shower, and keep them in a moist place at desert temperatures until sprouts appear. You'll also include three variables in your experiment. Click each variable to learn more about it. When you're finished, click "Run Experiment" to do the experiment.
