You have shown that <i>Pectis</i> seeds measure rainfall in a summer storm, and they use the result to "decide" whether to germinate. But how do the seeds measure rainfall?  One idea is that wet seeds build a substance that promotes germination; a heavy rain leads to enough promoter; a light rain does not.
