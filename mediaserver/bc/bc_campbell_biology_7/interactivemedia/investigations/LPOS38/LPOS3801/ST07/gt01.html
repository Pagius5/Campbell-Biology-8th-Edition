As in your experiments, scientists think inhibitors in <i>Pectis</i> seeds prevent germination until a summer rain washes away the inhibitors. This requires 25 mm of rainfall, which wets the ground enough to supply all the water that <i>Pectis</i> plants will need in their 3-week lives. We still don't know what the inhibitor is; maybe one day YOU will find out by analyzing wash water from the seeds.  But some desert plants use coumarin or phenolic compounds as inhibitors, and others have quite different ways to decide when to sprout. All methods, though, help these plants to persist in the harsh desert environment.  To wrap up, answer Question 10.
