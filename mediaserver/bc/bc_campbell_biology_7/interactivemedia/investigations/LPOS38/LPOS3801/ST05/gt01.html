Did you propose that rain might wash away a substance that inhibits germination? That's a good possibility. You know that lack of drainage prevents germination, and that's just what you'd expect if drainage washes away an inhibitor&mdash;but that's also what you expect if drainage brings in oxygen to make a promoter. In other words, both hypotheses explain what we've seen so far. To choose between the two hypotheses, you need another experiment that only one of them can pass.<p>
With other plants that behave like <i>Pectis</i>, one approach that's solved the issue is to soak seeds in water, and use the wash water as "rain" for other seeds that haven't been soaked.<p>
Use Question 8 to plan a similar experiment with <i>Pectis</i> seeds. Be sure to describe all the details.
