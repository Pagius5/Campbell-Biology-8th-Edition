In Experiment 1, you will compare oxygen consumption in three rats.  One rat is normal. The second is thyroidectomized (abbreviated on the screen as Tx)&#8212; meaning its <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('thyroid.html');return false;">thyroid</a> has been removed. The third is hypophysectomized (abbreviated on the screen as Hypox)&#8212; meaning its <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('pituitarygland.html');return false;">pituitary gland</a> has been removed.<p>
1. Drag the normal rat into the chamber and place it on top of the scale. Be sure the clamp on the left tube (on top of the chamber) is open, allowing for air to enter the chamber.  If the clamp is closed, click on it to open it. Be sure the indicator next to the T-connector reads "Chamber and manometer connected."  If not, click on the T-connector knob.<p>
2. Click on the Weigh button to weigh the rat.<p>
3. Click the (+) button on the Timer so that the Timer display reads 1.0 minute.<p>
4. Now click on the clamp to close it.  This will prevent any outside air from entering the chamber, and ensure that the only oxygen the rat is breathing is the oxygen inside the closed system.<p>
5. Click Start on the Timer display. Watch what happens to the water levels in the U-shaped tube as time elapses.<p>
6. When the timer stops, click on the T-connector and then click on the clamp to open it so that the rat can once again breathe outside air.<p>
7. Click the (+) button under "ml O<sub>2</sub>" so that the display reads 1.0 ml.  Then click Inject, and watch what happens to the fluid levels.  Click the (+) button again and the Inject button again to add more oxygen. At first, you may wish to increase the amount of O<sub>2</sub> in whole number increments. Repeat until the fluid in the two arms of the U-tube is level again.  A "level" label will appear. The number displays the total amount of oxygen that you have injected. The amount of oxygen needed to be added to level the fluid in the two arms is equivalent to the amount of oxygen that the rat used up during the 1 minute in the closed chamber. Click on Record Data at the bottom right corner of the screen.<p>
8.  Click on the Questions window and answer Questions 1 and 2.<p>
9. Click the Reset button in the box labeled Apparatus and repeat the procedure for the thyroidectomized and hypophysectomized rats. Click on Record Data and answer Questions 3-5.<p>
When you have finished determining the oxygen consumption for all three specimens, one by one click on each Data Set row and click Clear Data Set. Then click on the Experiment 2 button at the top of the screen to continue.
