In Experiment 2, you will investigate the effects of thyroxine injections on the metabolic rates of all three rats.<p>
Please note that in a wet lab environment, you would normally need to inject thyroxine into a rat <i>daily</i> for 1-2 weeks minimum in order for any response to be seen.  However, in the following simulations, you will only inject the rat once and be able to witness the same results as if you had administered multiple injections over the course of several weeks.  In addition, by clicking the Clean button while a rat is inside its cage, you can immediately remove all residue of any previously injected <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('hormone.html');return false;">hormone</a> from the rat and perform a new experiment on the same rat.  In a real wet lab environment, you would need to either wait weeks for hormonal residue to leave the rat's system, or use a different rat.<p>
1.  Click the Reset button in the box labeled Apparatus.<p>
2. Select a rat to test.  You will eventually test all three, so it doesn't matter what order you test them in.<p>
3. Your rat should be inside of its cage (not the chamber).  Click and drag the syringe labeled thyroxine over the rat to inject the specimen.<p>
4. Move the rat into the chamber.  Repeat the procedure from the previous experiment: <br>
<ul>
<li>Open clamp.</li>
<li>Click Weigh button.</li>
<li>Set timer for 1 minute.</li>
<li>Close clamp.</li>
<li>Click Start button.</li>
<li>When timer stops, open clamp.</li>
<li>Inject oxygen until fluid is level.</li>
<li>Click Record Data button.</li></ul><br>
5. Reset the apparatus and click Clean on the top left of the cage to cleanse the rat of all traces of thyroxine.<p>
Repeat this procedure for the remaining rats.  Then answer Questions 6-11. When you have finished determining the effects of thyroxine on all three specimens, one by one click on each Data Set row and click Clear Data Set. Then click on the Experiment 3 button at the top of the screen to continue.
