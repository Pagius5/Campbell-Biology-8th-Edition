The most important <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('hormone.html');return false;">hormone</a> in maintaining <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('metabolism.html');return false;">metabolism</a> and body heat is thyroxine, a hormone of the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('thyroidgland.html');return false;">thyroid gland</a>, found in the neck.  The thyroid gland secretes thyroxine, but the production of thyroxine is really controlled by the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('pituitarygland.html');return false;">pituitary gland</a>, which secretes <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('thyroidstimulatinghormonet.html');return false;">thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)</a>.  TSH is carried by the blood to the thyroid gland, and causes the thyroid to produce more thyroxine. In the following experiments, you will be investigating the effects of thyroxine and TSH on an animal's metabolic rate by measuring oxygen consumption, which is directly proportional to heat production.<p>
Notice the jar-shaped chamber to the left, connected to a respirometer-manometer apparatus. You will place rats in the chamber in order to measure the amount of oxygen used by the animal. Two tubes are connected to the top of the chamber.<p>
The left tube has a clamp on it that can be opened or closed.  Leaving the clamp open will allow outside air into the chamber; closing the clamp will create a closed, airtight system.<p>
The other tube leads to a T-connector.  One branch of the T leads to a fluid-containing a U-shaped tube, called a manometer.  As an animal uses up the air in the closed system, this fluid will rise in the left side of the U-shaped tube and fall in the right. The other branch of the T-connector leads to a syringe filled with oxygen.  Using the syringe to inject oxygen into the tube, you will measure the amount of oxygen that is needed to return the fluid columns to their original levels.  This measurement will be equal to the amount of oxygen used by the animal during the elapsed time of the experiment. The amount of oxygen used by the animal, along with its weight, will be used to calculate the animal's oxygen consumption per kilogram of body weight per hour.<p>
