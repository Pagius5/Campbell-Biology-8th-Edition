A minority of paleontologists feels that <i>Archaeopteryx</i> evolved much earlier from pre-dinosaurs called archosaurs.  They point to the small archosaur thecodont dinosaurs that lived about 245 million years ago as likely candidates.  These scientists point out that coelurosaurs couldn't possibly be the immediate ancestors of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> because the small, bipedal coelurosaurs didn't evolve until 70 million years <i>after</i> the time when <i>Archaeopteryx</i> lived.<p>
Recently, another fossil of a bird-like reptile called <i>Longisquama insignis</i> was discovered.  <i>Longisquama</i> lived about 225 million years ago and was a thecodont reptile.<p>
What excites the proponents of the archosaur-to-birds theory are the plume-like appendages attached to the back.  If these plumes are true feathers, then <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and modern birds separated from the thecodonts and evolved in a separate lineage than the dinosaurs.  However, a number of paleontologists question whether these impressions might merely be skin flaps or membranes and not feathers.<p>
