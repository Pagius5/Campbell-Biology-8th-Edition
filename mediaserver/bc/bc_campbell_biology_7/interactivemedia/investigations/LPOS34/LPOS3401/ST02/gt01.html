The skeleton of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> is strikingly similar to a group of small, carnivorous, bipedal dinosaurs called coelurosaurs.  In fact, skeletons and fossils of small coelurosaur dinosaurs like <i>Compsognathus</i> and <i>Bambiraptor</i> (named for the deer in the Disney movie for its diminutive size) shown at left have even been confused with <i>Archaeopteryx</i>.  The <i>Velociraptor</i> from Michael Crichton's <i>Jurassic Park</i> was such a dinosaur too. The abundant similarities and the age of the <i>Archaeopteryx</i> fossils strongly support the idea that birds evolved from dinosaur coelurosaurs, sometime around the late Jurassic Period.<p>
Compare <i>Archaeopteryx</i> to <i>Compsognathus</i> and <i>Bambiraptor</i> and answer Question 2.
