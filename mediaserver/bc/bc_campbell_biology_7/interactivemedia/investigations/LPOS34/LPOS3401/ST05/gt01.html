Recent research on the bones of birds, <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('dinosaurs.html');return false;">dinosaurs</a>, and mammals has shed some light on the rival theories of where birds came from.  By slicing animal bones into very thin sections, the holes where the bone cells live (<a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('lacunae.html');return false;">lacunae</a>) and the large canals where blood vessels deliver oxygen and nutrients (<a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('haversiancanals.html');return false;">Haversian canals</a>) can be seen under a microscope.  Connecting the bone cells together are many tiny branching canals (<a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('canaliculi.html');return false;">canaliculi</a>) that radiate outward from each lacuna.<p>
An interesting observation has been made between the structure of the canaliculi and the type of animal or reptile the bone comes from.  Some canaliculi radiate outward from the lacunae in parallel with the direction of bone deposition.  Wherever these canaliculi divide, the branches run almost parallel to the parent canaliculus.  In bones from other animals, the branching canaliculi diverge in random directions from the parent canaliculus.  Thus, two types of bones emerge: one with very organized, nearly parallel canaliculi and the other with randomly oriented canaliculi.<p>
Specialized computer software was developed by paleontologist John Rensberger at the University of Washington to quantitate what percentage of the branching canaliculi extended in specific directions.  In this activity, you will analyze bone sections from modern birds, dinosaurs, and mammals to detect what type of canaliculi pattern they have.  Then you will analyze whether these patterns lend support to the dinosaur vs. archosaur debate on the origins of birds.<p>
   Click on the Lab Notebook window. Then click on each photo to see an enlarged photo and a graph produced by the computer software.  Identify in each animal whether the canaliculi (the tiny lines radiating out from the oval-shaped dark lacunae) radiate in random directions (no one direction favored), or whether a specific canaliculi direction is most common.   Record your results in the Lab Notebook.
