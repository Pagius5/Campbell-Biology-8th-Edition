There is widespread agreement that <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('birds.html');return false;">birds</a> evolved from <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('reptiles.html');return false;">reptiles</a>; in fact, they <i>are</i> technically reptiles.  Birds have scales on their feet and an amniotic egg like modern reptiles.  They also share many skeletal similarities.<p>
The oldest known birdlike animal (known through fossils) is <i>Archaeopteryx lithographia</i>. This proto-bird lived about 145 million years ago during the Age of the Dinosaurs. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> shows many features that suggest it is a transitional form between dinosaur reptiles and modern birds. It has teeth like dinosaurs, clawed forelimbs, and a long tail containing <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('vertebrae.html');return false;">vertebrae</a>.  Unlike dinosaurs, <i>Archaeopteryx</i> had <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('feathers.html');return false;">feathers</a>, and probably was a weak flier.<p>
