How can the rate of cellular respiration be measured? When you study the equation for cellular respiration, you will see that there are at least three ways:<p>
1. Measure the amount of glucose consumed.<br>
2. Measure the amount of oxygen consumed.<br>
3. Measure the amount of carbon dioxide produced.<p>
In this experiment, we will measure the amount of oxygen consumed.<p>
The illustration at left shows you the basic features of a respirometer. This instrument measures changes in gas volume related to the consumption of oxygen.<p>
Cellular respiration occurs in the cells of both plants and animals. You can construct a respirometer by putting any small organism in a vial with a pipette attached.<p>
Click the respirometer to see how it works.
