Suppose you collected data for the amount of oxygen consumed over time by germinating and nongerminating peas at two different temperatures. You want to compare the rates of respiration. Let's review how to calculate rate.<p>
Rate = slope of the line, or &#916;<i>y</i>/&#916;<i>X</i><p>
In this case,  y is the change in volume, and x is the change in time (10 min).<p>
Calculate a rate of respiration based on the diagram at left. Type your answer in the box; then click on "check answer."
