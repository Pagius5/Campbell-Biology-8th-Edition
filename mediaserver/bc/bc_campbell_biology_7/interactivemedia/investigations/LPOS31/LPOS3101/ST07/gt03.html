Research has shown that the subsporangial swelling of <i>Pilobolus</i> acts as a lens that focuses light on the growing point of the sporangiophore.  When light comes from the side, light is focused on the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cytoplasm.html');return false;">cytoplasm</a> on the far side of the growing point, causing that side of the sporangiophore to elongate more rapidly. Once the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('sporangium.html');return false;">sporangium</a> is pointing in the direction of the light, the growing point elongates at an even rate all around so that the sporangiophore keeps growing in the direction of the light source until the sporangium is shot. Other fungi that shoot their <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('spores.html');return false;">spores</a> and grow exclusively on manure can also aim their spores toward the source of light.<p>
These responses appear to be adaptations to increase the chance that when spores are shot, they will be aimed off the manure that they are growing on.  Now answer Question 7.<p>
So how are <i>Pilobolus</i> and other fungi successful decomposers? These manure decomposing specialists are successful decomposers, in part, because they have evolved mechanisms that serve to disperse their spores to places that will increase their chances of ending up in the right habitat for successful growth and reproduction.
