Watch the progress of development of the sporangiophores and <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('sporangia.html');return false;">sporangia</a> of <i>Pilobolus</i>. Your observations may help you determine how the sporangia (the black dots) get on the lid.<p>
Notice that the number of sporangia on the lid increases as the number of erect sporangiophores decreases.  This suggests that the sporangia are actively shot from the sporangiophores. Also notice that the vast majority of them are pointing in the same direction and that most of the sporangia are found on the side of the lid toward which the sporangiophores were pointing. All of these observations and your previously recorded experiments suggest that the sporangiophores can aim their sporangia toward some stimulus and actively shoot sporangia. Let us now test the following hypothesis:<p>
Hypothesis I:  <i>Pilobolus</i> can aim its sporangia toward light before shooting them in that direction.
