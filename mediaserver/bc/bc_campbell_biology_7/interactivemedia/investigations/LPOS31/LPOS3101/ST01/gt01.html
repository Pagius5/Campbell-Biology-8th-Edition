Many fungi are <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('decomposers.html');return false;">decomposers</a>.  What does this mean?  It means they break down the complex organic <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('molecules.html');return false;">molecules</a> of dead organisms and release simpler <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('compounds.html');return false;">compounds</a> into the environment.  In the process, they use these compounds as energy and nutrient sources.  When you use cow manure as a fertilizer in your garden, you rely on the activity of decomposers, including fungi, to provide nutrients for your plants.  Fungi do this by digesting and metabolizing the organic compounds that are present in the pieces of dead plants that are found in manure.<p>
On fresh manure you can't see any obvious fungi, but if you wait a few days, fungi become visible. By collecting cow manure from a pasture and placing it in a container in the lab, it is quite easy to observe the growth of fungi over a period of several weeks.  You will see that there are many species of zygomycetes, ascomycetes, and basidiomycetes that are found almost exclusively on manure.<p>
In order for these fungi to be successful decomposers of manure, they must first arrive on it.  How do you think these fungi might get to the manure? We will investigate the mechanisms that make a fungus successful as a decomposer. Consider these two hypotheses:<br>
1. <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('spores.html');return false;">Spores</a> or <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('mycelium.html');return false;">mycelium</a> may be carried to the fresh manure by wind or insects.<br>
2. Spores or mycelium may have been eaten by the cow, passed through its digestive system, and deposited by the cow when it defecated.<p>
Continue to the next step to investigate these two hypotheses.
