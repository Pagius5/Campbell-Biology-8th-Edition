Let us test the first hypothesis that spores and/or <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('mycelium.html');return false;">mycelium</a> arrive on the manure after it is deposited by the cow.  We will do this in two ways: an observational and an experimental approach.<p>
Let's focus on the really obvious fungi that appear on manure.  The most obvious fungus we see within a few days of observing the manure is the zygomycete genus <i>Pilobolus</i>. You identify <i>Pilobolus</i> on the basis of its asexual spore-bearing structure.  For orientation, examine and review the parts of this reproductive structure. Since reproductive structures cannot develop unless the mycelium is already present, you will record the presence of <i>Pilobolus</i> if you see it sporulating.<p>
For both tests you will go to a cow pasture where <i>Pilobolus</i> is known to occur.  You will collect samples of manure and place them each into sterilized dishes.  You will moisten each sample lightly with sterilized water and cover the dish.  Observe each sample daily for one week and record whether <i>Pilobolus</i> occurs in the sample. Proceed to the next step to begin.
