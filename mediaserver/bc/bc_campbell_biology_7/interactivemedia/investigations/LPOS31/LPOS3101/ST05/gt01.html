Your results, which have been discovered by others as well, support the hypothesis that <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('spores.html');return false;">spores</a> have been eaten by the cow, passed through its digestive system, and deposited by the cow when it defecated. This means that the spores remained viable as they passed through its digestive system.  In fact, experiments on the germination of <i>Pilobolus</i> spores and the spores of other manure-inhabiting fungi show that they will not germinate until they have been treated with conditions that mimic passing through a herbivore.  If the cow must eat the spores for <i>Pilobolus</i> to grow and help decompose its manure, where do the spores have to be deposited in order to be ingested?<p>To pursue this question, first ask yourself what does a cow in a pasture eat? Most likely, grass and other plants.  Theoretically, the cow could eat manure and ingest some spores, but observations show that cows rarely eat manure. If a cow eats plants, how do the spores produced on manure get from the manure to the plants?<p>For a clue, click on the plate on the left (from your earlier experiment in which <i>Pilobolus</i> sporulated) and look on the lid.  What do you see?
