The results suggest that at least some of the <i>Pilobolus</i> <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('mycelium.html');return false;">mycelium</a> was present when the cow defecated, but is it possible that some of the <i>Pilobolus</i> on the older manure developed from <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('spores.html');return false;">spores</a> that reached it after it had been on the ground a while?<p>TEST 2 &#150; Modified Hypothesis:  Some spores and/or mycelium arrive after manure is deposited and contribute to the population of <i>Pilobolus</i> on the manure.  An experimental approach.<p>
1. Randomly collect 40, 100g samples of manure that are as fresh as possible.<br>
2. Randomly select 10 of the samples and set them aside. Plate out these samples and label as Treatment I.<br>
3. Sterilize the other 30 samples in an autoclave.  (This is an apparatus that kills organisms by the use of heat and pressure.)<br>
4. Plate out 10 of the sterilized samples and immediately cover the dishes.  This is Treatment II.<br>
5. Plate out another 10 sterilized samples, and leave them exposed to the air in the pasture for one day before covering the dishes.  This is Treatment III.<br>
6. Plate out the final 10 sterilized samples and inoculate them with growing mycelium of <i>Pilobolus</i>.  Cover them as soon as they are inoculated.  This is Treatment IV.<p>
Answer Questions 3 and 4.<p>
Now enter the number 1 in the "Day" box, click "Observe," and record the results. Do the same for days 2-7. Then answer Question 5.
