In this case study, you will use paper chromatography to separate plant pigments. Paper chromatography is a technique used to separate a mixture into its component <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('molecules.html');return false;">molecules</a>. The molecules migrate, or move up the paper, at different rates because of differences in solubility, molecular mass, and <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('hydrogenbonding.html');return false;">hydrogen bonding</a> with the paper. <p>
For a simple, beautiful example of this technique, draw a large circle in the center of a piece of filter paper with a black, water-soluble, felt-tip pen. Fold the paper into a cone and place the tip in a container of water. In just a few minutes you will have tie-dyed filter paper! The green, blue, red, and lavender colors that came from the black ink should help you to understand that what appears to be a single color may in fact be a material composed of many different pigments, and such is the case with <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('chloroplasts.html');return false;">chloroplasts</a>.
