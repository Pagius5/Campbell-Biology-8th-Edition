The result would be a chromatogram, a pattern of colors like the one shown in Step 1. In the simulation here, lines represent the distance each pigment has moved from the origin. Measure the distance the solvent moved (the solvent front) and the distance each pigment moved. Click on the Lab Notebook window and record these results. Click the Reset button and repeat twice, for different lengths of time. Record your results in your Lab Notebook.<p>
When you do chromatographic separations for different lengths of time, the pigments migrate a different distance on each run. However, the migration of each pigment relative to the migration of the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('solvent.html');return false;">solvent</a> does not change. This migration of pigment relative to migration of solvent is expressed as a constant, Rf (Reference front). It can be used to identify a specific pigment and is calculated by using the formula on the left.<p>
So for example, if the solvent traveled 8 cm and pigment X traveled 6 cm, then the Rf can be calculated by dividing 6 cm by 8 cm. The Rf value would be 0.75.<p>
Record your data in your Lab Notebook.
