The illustration at left shows how test tubes can be illuminated for the measurement of percent transmittance. Pigments absorb in the visible range of the spectrum (380&#150;760 nm). After the test tubes are illuminated, the spectrophotometer is used to measure the percentage of transmittance at wavelength 605 nm.<p>
If DPIP is in an oxidized state, it will be blue, and the percentage of light transmitted will be low. By contrast, if chlorophyll's electrons have been excited and move on to reduce the DPIP, the sample will become progressively paler, allowing more light energy to pass through the sample. We can measure this change over time until the sample has been completely reduced and is almost colorless. At this point, the percentage of transmittance is very high.<p>
For this experiment, tube 1 (the blank) contains all the solutions used in the reaction except the DPIP. Because tube 1 contains chloroplasts but not DPIP, it is green and is used to calibrate the spectrophotometer. Tubes 2, 3, and 4 are experimental and contain DPIP with either boiled or unboiled chloroplasts.<p>
