In this investigation, you will explore how the rate of photosynthesis is measured. First, the thylakoid membranes of the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('chloroplasts.html');return false;">chloroplasts</a> are mechanically disrupted so that the natural electron transport chain no longer functions normally. Then the rate of electron excitation when light hits chlorophyll is measured by using DPIP, a blue compound, as an electron acceptor. When light strikes the chloroplasts, the DPIP is reduced by the excited electrons from chlorophyll, and it changes from its original blue color to colorless as it accepts the electrons. Click on the Start button to see a simplified animation of this process.<p>
A spectrophotometer can be used to measure the color change, which gives an indication of the rate of the light reactions of photosynthesis under various conditions. A spectrophotometer is an instrument that can be adjusted to illuminate a sample with a specific wavelength of light. The spectrophotometer then measures the amount of light energy absorbed or transmitted by the sample. As DPIP goes from blue to colorless, the amount of light of wavelength 605 nm transmitted through the sample increases. Though you can note this color change visually, the spectrophotometer quantifies the change.<p>
