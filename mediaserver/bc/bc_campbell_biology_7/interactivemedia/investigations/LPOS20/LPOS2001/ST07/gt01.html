If there is no ampicillin in the agar, <i>E. coli</i> will cover the plate with so many cells it is called a "lawn" of cells.<p>
Only transformed cells can grow on agar with ampicillin. Because only some of the cells exposed to the amp<sup>R</sup> plasmids will actually take them in, only some cells will be transformed. Thus you will see only individual colonies on the plate.<p>
If none of the sensitive <i>E. coli</i> cells have been transformed, nothing will grow on the agar with ampicillin.
