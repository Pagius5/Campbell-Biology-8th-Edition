<i>Escherichia coli</i> is the most common bacterium in the human gut. It has been extensively studied in the laboratory and is an important research organism for molecular biology.<p>
<i>E. coli</i> reproduce very rapidly; a single microscopic cell can divide to form a visible colony with millions of cells overnight. Like all bacteria, <i>E. coli</i> has no nuclear envelope surrounding the bacterial chromosome and thus no true nucleus. All of the genes required for basic survival and reproduction are found in the single chromosome. Some <i>E. coli</i> cells also contain plasmids, small DNA molecules that carry genes for certain specialized functions, including resistance to specific drugs.
