Practice using the standard curve to determine the size of fragments in two samples, DNAI and DNAII. This procedure is illustrated at left and described below.<p>
1. Find the distance migrated for each unknown fragment size of the sample DNAII.<p>
2. Locate this distance on the graph and follow the line to its intersection with the standard curve.<p>
3. Read the number of base pairs in the unknown fragment from the graph. Record your answers in the Practice Problem 1 table in the Lab Notebook.
