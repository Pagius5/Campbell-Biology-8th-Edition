Each fragment of DNA is a particular number of nucleotides, or base pairs, long. When researchers want to determine the size of DNA fragments produced with particular restriction enzymes, they run the unknown DNA alongside DNA with known fragment sizes. The known DNA acts as a marker. In your laboratory, the DNA that has been cut with HindIII is the marker; you will use it to help you determine the fragment sizes in the EcoRI digest. Below, we go through the procedure using HindIII and two generalized DNA samples.<p>
If you know the fragment sizes in the HindIII digest, how do you determine the fragment sizes in an unknown sample? You use data from the marker to prepare a standard curve, which provides a standard for comparison to the unknown fragment sizes. Using a standard to estimate an unknown is sometimes called "interpolation"; you will interpolate the size of the unknown fragments.<p>
You begin by making a standard curve for the known sample, DNA plus HindIII. Click on the Lab Notebook window. Then measure the distance each HindIII fragment migrated on the gel at left and record the distances in the first table in the Lab Notebook. You can use the "Check answer" button to confirm whether each measurement is correct. Click "Show answer" to see all the answers.
