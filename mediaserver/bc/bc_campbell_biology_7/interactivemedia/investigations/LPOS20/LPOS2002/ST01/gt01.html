In the 1960s, scientists discovered that bacteria have enzymes that cut, or "digest," the DNA of foreign organisms and thereby protect the cells from invaders such as viruses. Scientists have now isolated several hundred of these enzymes, known as <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('restrictionenzymes.html');return false;">restriction enzymes</a>, or restriction endonucleases. Each is able to recognize and cut at a specific DNA sequence, known as a recognition sequence.<p>
The discovery of restriction enzymes made genetic engineering possible because researchers could use them to cut DNA into fragments, which could be analyzed and used in a variety of procedures.
