You are now ready to start identifying trees. By closely observing a tree in the photo at left, you will identify it by answering a series of questions about its leaves.<p>
These questions are called a dichotomous key: a tool that allows you to determine the identity of a plant using photos, diagrams, and written descriptions of the leaves of that plant. The key is based on making successive choices between two statements (the term "dichotomous" means "forked" or "splitting" ).<p>
1. Read the two contrasting statements at left as you closely observe the leaf of Tree 1. One statement of the pair will match the description of your leaf better than the other. In order to make an educated choice, you must always read both statements before making your decision.<p>
2. After choosing the statement that best matches your leaf, you will be directed to consider the next pair of statements. After you have selected correctly for all the statements, you will be shown the plant you have identified.<p>
3. Once you have correctly identified Tree 1, record the tree name and leaf characteristics in your Lab Notebook.<p>
Use your Lab Notebook observations to answer Question 3. Then click on Tree 2.
