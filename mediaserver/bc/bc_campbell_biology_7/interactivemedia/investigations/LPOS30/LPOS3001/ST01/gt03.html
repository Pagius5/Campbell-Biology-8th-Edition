The next step in identifying a tree is to recognize the pattern of veins in its leaf or its leaf venation. The two images at top left show the two types of venation: pinnately netted and palmately netted.<p>
- Pinnately netted: looks like a bird's feather, with a midrib and numerous veins extending outward.<br>
- Palmately netted: has large veins extending from the petiole, spreading throughout the blade, giving the appearance of an outstretched hand. <p>
Notice that the leaves of these different venations can either be simple or compound. The leaves in the top row at left are simple; those at bottom are compound:<p>
- Ash leaf. The small axillary bud is barely visible where the stem and petiole join.<br>
- Horse Chestnut. The axillary bud is not as visible but you can see that this large leaf has a petiole attached to the stem. Notice that its leaflets all extend from one place. If we draw an imaginary line from leaflet apex to leaflet apex, we can see that the overall vein pattern is, in fact, palmately netted, so we can refer to this leaf as a palmately compound leaf.<p>
Remember that vein pattern refers to the entire leaf, not to the individual leaflet.<p>
