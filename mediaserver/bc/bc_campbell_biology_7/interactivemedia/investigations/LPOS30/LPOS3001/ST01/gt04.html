Leaves are not attached to stems in a random way. There is a very specific pattern. <p>
Observe the illustrations at left, showing the most common leaf attachment patterns and locate the important axillary buds. There are three main patterns:<p>
- Alternate: has one leaf attached along a stem (with no other leaf at that site).<br>
- Opposite: has two leaves at each site, the leaf arrangement is opposite.<br>
- Whorled: has more than two leaves attached at a single site, the leaf arrangement is whorled.<p>
You are now ready to test your observation skills and your new knowledge of leaf characteristics terminology. Click on the Observe button at left.
