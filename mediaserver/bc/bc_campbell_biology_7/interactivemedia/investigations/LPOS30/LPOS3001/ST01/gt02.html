At left are two examples of leaf type: simple and compound.<p>
Examine the simple leaf. It consists of a single <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('blade.html');return false;">blade</a> connected to the stem by a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('petiole.html');return false;">petiole</a>. The blade may be further described according to specific features of the apex (or tip) and the margin (or edge). Also notice a distinct pattern of veins visible within the blade. The largest of the veins, extending down the middle of this poplar leaf, is the midrib (or midvein). <p>
You can also see the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('axillarybud.html');return false;">axillary bud</a>, formed in the angle between the petiole and the stem. Because not all leaves look like this example (many are divided further into smaller components) it is critical that you locate the axillary bud. The bud tells you that everything extending away from the stem from the bud is one leaf, even though it may look like numerous small leaves.<p>
Examine the compound leaf. How is it different from the simple leaf? Like the simple leaf, it has a petiole. But instead of one leaf extending from the axillary bud, it has multiple leaflets attached to a central support called a rachis.  Not all compound leaves look alike, but they are all composed of leaflets.<p>
