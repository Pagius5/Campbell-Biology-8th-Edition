All leaves are not alike across tree species; but a species of tree will always produce leaves that are identical in detail. Thus it is possible to identify a tree by using leaf characteristics.<p>
To do this successfully, you will first learn to recognize some of the features scientists use:<p>
- Leaf Type (Simple or Compound)<br>
- Leaf Venation (Pinnate or Palmate)<br>
- Leaf Arrangement (Alternate, Opposite, or Whorled)<p>
