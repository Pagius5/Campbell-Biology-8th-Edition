Now you will test the effect of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('hormones.html');return false;">hormones</a> on urine formation. The concentration of the urine excreted by our kidneys changes depending on our immediate needs. For example, if a person consumes a large quantity of water, the excess water will be eliminated, producing dilute urine. On the other hand, under conditions of dehydration, there is a clear benefit in being able to produce urine as concentrated as possible, thereby retaining precious water. Although the medullary gradient makes it possible to excrete concentrated urine, urine dilution or concentration is ultimately under hormonal control.<p>
In this experiment, you will investigate the effects of two different hormones on renal function, <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('aldosterone.html');return false;">aldosterone</a> produced by the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('adrenalgland.html');return false;">adrenal gland</a>, and <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('antidiuretichormone.html');return false;">ADH</a> manufactured by the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('hypothalamus.html');return false;">hypothalamus</a> and stored in the posterior <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('pituitarygland.html');return false;">pituitary gland</a>. Aldosterone works to reabsorb Na<sup>+</sup> (and thereby water) at the expense of losing K+. Its site of action is the distal convoluted tubule. ADH makes the distal tubule and collecting duct more permeable to water, thereby allowing the body to reabsorb more water from the filtrate when it is present.<p>
1. Make sure that Hormone is selected under Data Sets and that the valve above the urine beaker is open. Set the concentration gradient at 1200 mOsm and click Dispense.<p>
2. Click Start to begin the experiment.<p>
3. After the experiment has run, click Record Data. This will be your baseline data to compare with the conditions of the filtrate under the control of the two hormones.<p>
4. Now drag the aldosterone bottle to the top right side of the nephron tank dropper. Click Start and then click Record Data when the experiment is complete. Answer Questions 4 and 5.<p>
5. Now add ADH to the nephron tank. Start the experiment and click Record Data when the experiment is complete. Answer Questions 6-10.
