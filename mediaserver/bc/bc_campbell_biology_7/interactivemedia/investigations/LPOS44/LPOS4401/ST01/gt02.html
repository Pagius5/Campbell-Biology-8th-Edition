First let's explore the role of the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('solute.html');return false;">solute</a> gradient on achieving maximum urine concentration. In the process of urine formation, solutes and water move from the lumen of the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('nephron.html');return false;">nephron</a> into the interstitial spaces. The passive movement of solutes and water from the lumen of the renal tubule into the interstitial spaces relies in part on the total solute gradient surrounding the nephron.<p>
When the nephron is permeable to solutes or water, an equilibrium will be reached between the interstitial fluid and the contents of the nephron. <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('antidiuretichormone.html');return false;">Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)</a> increases the water permeability of the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct, allowing water to flow to areas of higher solute concentration, usually from the lumen of the nephron into the surrounding interstitial area.<p>
You will explore the process of passive reabsorption in this experiment. While doing this part of the simulation, assume that when ADH is present, the conditions favor the formation of the most concentrated urine possible.<p>
1. Make sure that Gradient is selected under Data Sets and that the valve above the urine beaker is open. Drag the ADH dropper to the opening at the top right side of the nephron tank. <p>
2. Adjust the maximum total solute concentration of the gradient (Conc. Grad.) to 300 mOsm. The unit mOsm is equal to 0.001 osmol, which is equivalent to 1 mole of a nonionizing substance in 1 L of water.<p>
3. Click Dispense.<p>
4. Click Start to begin the experiment. While the experiment is running and when the Probe turns red, drag it over the urine beaker to observe the total solute concentration in the Concentration window.<p>
5. After the experiment has run, click the Record Data button at the bottom of the screen.<p>
6. Increase the maximum concentration gradient in 300 mOsm increments and repeat the experiment until 1200 mOsm. Be sure to add ADH before each experiment and to click Record Data after each one.<p>
Review your data. Then click on the Questions window and answer questions 1, 2, and 3. Click on the Hormones Experiment button to proceed to the next experiment.
