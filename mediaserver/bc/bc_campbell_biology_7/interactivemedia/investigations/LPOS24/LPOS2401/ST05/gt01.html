If pollen from the tetraploid (12 chromosomes) plant fertilized eggs from the original diploid (6 chromosomes) plants, triploid zygotes with a total of 9 chromosomes would result. Such a zygote could undergo <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('mitosis.html');return false;">mitosis</a>, growing into a triploid individual. But the triploid hybrid plant would be sterile. <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('homologouschromosomes.html');return false;">Homologous chromosomes</a> are supposed to pair up in <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('meiosis.html');return false;">meiosis</a>. In the triploid, some of the chromosomes would lack partners, meiosis would go awry, and no gametes would be produced.<p>
Using this information, answer Question 4.
