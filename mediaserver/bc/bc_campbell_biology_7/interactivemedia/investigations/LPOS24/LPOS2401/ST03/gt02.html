Correct. This <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('zygote.html');return false;">zygote</a> would have a total of 12 chromosomes. Extra sets of chromosomes is termed <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('polyploidy.html');return false;">polyploidy</a>. This particular zygote is tetraploid, because it has 4 sets of chromosomes, instead of the usual 2 sets. The zygote could develop into a tetraploid plant. In plants, such polyploids are often viable and even vigorous. This individual is an <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('autopolyploid.html');return false;">autopolyploid</a>, because it has more than two sets of chromosomes that are all derived from a single species.<p>
2. Use this principle to answer Question 2.
