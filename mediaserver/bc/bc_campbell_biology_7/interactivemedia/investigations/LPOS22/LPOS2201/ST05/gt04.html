8. Record your observations about the 30th generation of leafhoppers.<p>
9. Use this information to answer Question 10.<p>
The examples in this module asked you to do a simple visual analysis of population changes in leafhoppers. Biologists investigating environmental impacts on population dynamics would use statistical analyses to evaluate significant shifts in trait frequencies. Formulas such as the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium Equation (discussed in Chapter 23) could be used to determine if the future evolution of the leafhoppers is being driven by the changing environmental factors. An interesting model of population selection of dogs under different environmental conditions can be found on the web: <a href="http://www.nmsu.edu/~molbio/dog/nature.htm" target = "_blank">Modeling Natural Selection Using Populations of Dog Breeds</a>.
