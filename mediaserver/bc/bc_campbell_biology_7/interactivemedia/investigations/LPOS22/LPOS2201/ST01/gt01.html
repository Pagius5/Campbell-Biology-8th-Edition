Darwin's theory of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('naturalselection.html');return false;">natural selection</a> states that individuals that are better adapted to their environment are more likely than less fit individuals to survive and reproduce. Over the generations, the favored traits tend to accumulate in the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('population.html');return false;">population</a>, resulting in adaptive evolution. Let's look at this process in a hypothetical population of leafhoppers. Within a population of leafhoppers, one can observe individuals of different sizes and colors. These differences may grant advantages or disadvantages for the dissimilar individuals. For example, differences in coloration may alter susceptibility to predation by birds or reptiles. Offspring with small bodies may have advantages over larger bodied individuals by needing fewer resources to survive. If the environment changes, however, different traits may become advantageous. In this activity we will investigate how environmental changes affect the proportion of each trait in this population of leafhoppers.<p>
