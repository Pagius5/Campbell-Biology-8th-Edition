The next study looks at the effects of a change in vegetation on a leafhopper population. This change can occur as a result of natural causes such as severe weather, earthquakes, or a shift in the path of a river, or as a result of human disturbances such as agriculture and development<p>
1. Changes in vegetation can be happening where you live or go to school. Think about what is going on in your location to answer Question 7.<p>
2. In your Lab Notebook, record your observations for the parental generation in the data table for change in vegetation.<p>
3. Now let's see what happens to the leafhopper population when its habitat and source of food changes. Click on the 10th Generation button to see the outcome of different vegetation after 10 generations of leafhoppers.
