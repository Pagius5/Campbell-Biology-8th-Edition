The news is full of stories about new strains of deadly <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('bacteria.html');return false;">bacteria</a>. At one time, these organisms were easily treated with commonly available <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('antibiotics.html');return false;">antibiotics</a>. Today many bacteria have become antibiotic resistant. Antibiotic-resistance traits can be transmitted from one bacterium to another through genetic exchange.<p>
Antibiotic resistance can result from the regular use of antibiotics to treat common bacterial infections. Ultimately, this leads to the selection of bacterial populations that are genetically capable of counteracting the antibiotics. Improper use, such as taking too small a dose or not completing a treatment, can also encourage selection of resistant populations.<p>
Let's test a strain of bacteria to see if it is resistant to penicillin or ampicillin, an artificial form of penicillin developed to replace penicillin. Drag a bacteria sample from the petri plate to each test tube. All of the test tubes contain a nutrient solution for growing bacteria, and two of them also contain an antibiotic. After inoculating all three test tubes, click on the "Incubate" button and note what happens to the bacterial growth.
