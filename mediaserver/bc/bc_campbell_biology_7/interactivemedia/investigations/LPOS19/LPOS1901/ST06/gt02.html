You designed the correct expression system. Note the appearance of the yeast cells in the 6 petri plates. In your Lab Notebook, record your observations for Beta-D-glucuronidase activity in the control group. Dark blue indicates high Beta-D-glucuronidase activity. Light blue indicates low Beta-D-glucuronidase activity.<p>
When you are done, proceed to the next step to design the aldehyde reductase expression system.
