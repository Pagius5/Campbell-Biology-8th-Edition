Note the appearance of the yeast cells in the 6 petri plates. Then record your observations for Beta-D-glucuronidase and firefly luciferase activity in the data table at the bottom left of the screen. Remember to record the DNA sequence you produced.<p>
Try another arrangement if equal expression of both proteins is not evident (brightly glowing yeast cells with a dark blue color).  Click on the "Another Trial" button to produce another arrangement.<p>
Click on the "Conclusions" button once you have produced 4 combinations that gave some expression of both genes.
