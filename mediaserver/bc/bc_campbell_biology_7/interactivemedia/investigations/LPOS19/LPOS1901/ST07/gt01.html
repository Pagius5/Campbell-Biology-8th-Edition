Now you are ready to do experimental trials to design a working aldehyde reductase promoter system that expresses the reporter genes.The goal is to get equal amounts of both <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('gene.html');return false;">gene</a> products.<p>
 You will be testing different expression systems by doing six trial sequences.  As shown on previous screens, for each trial the proximal control region should be placed before the promoter and the genes, while the terminator is last.  In between, try different orders for the promoter and the two genes. <p>
For Trial 1, use the following sequence: proximal control region, aldehyde reductase promoter, firefly luciferase gene, Beta-D-glucuronidase gene, terminator.  The Lab Notebook shows the results for Trial 1, with the letters 

<i> a f b </i>representing the order of the promoter and the two genes.  Continue the trials.  For each trial, record the sequence of the promoter and the two genes.  Then count the number of cells with high, low, or no activity for each type of gene expression.  Record the data in the Lab Notebook.
