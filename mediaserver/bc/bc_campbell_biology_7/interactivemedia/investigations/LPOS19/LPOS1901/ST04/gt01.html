You are being asked to design an expression system that produces equal amounts of two proteins programmed by separate <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('genes.html');return false;">genes</a>. This type of system is important for producing multipart proteins such as <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('antibodies.html');return false;">antibodies</a>, <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('hemoglobin.html');return false;">hemoglobin</a> and many <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('enzymes.html');return false;">enzymes</a>.<p>
To do this you must first ensure that the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('dna.html');return false;">DNA</a> segments are in the proper order to get gene expression. Then you have to test the system in a model organism to see if functional proteins are produced.  The model organism for this study is <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('yeast.html');return false;">yeast</a>. Being eukaryotes, yeasts provide a good indication that the expression system is appropriate for eukaryotic cells.<p>
To test your system you will be using two genes called reporter genes. Reporter genes give evidence that the expression system is properly doing its job.  You will also be provided with the aldehyde reductase promoter because of its success at expressing tandem genes.<p>
In steps 5 and 6 of this activity, you will set up a control for comparing the effectiveness of your system test. Then, in step 7, you will try your success at designing a working aldehyde reductase promoter system that expresses the reporter genes.
