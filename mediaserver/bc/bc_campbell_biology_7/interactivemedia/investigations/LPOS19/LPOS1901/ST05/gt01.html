For the control test group, you will use a proximal control region normally found in yeast that allows continuous binding of the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('rnapolymerase.html');return false;">RNA polymerase</a> to the promoter.  Therefore, an enhancer region will not be needed.<p>
The reporter <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('genes.html');return false;">genes</a> for this experiment will be the enzymes firefly luciferase and beta-D-glucuronidase. Firefly luciferase is tested by looking for a yellow glow when the substrates luciferin and <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('atp.html');return false;">ATP</a> are added. The brighter the glow, the greater is the expression of firefly luciferase. Beta-D-glucuronidase is indicated by looking for a blue color to the yeast when 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl glucuronide substrate is added under special conditions. The darker the blue, the greater is the Beta-D-glucuronidase expression.<p>
Before doing the experiment, first note the appearance of the yeast cells in the 6 petri plates. These cells are not expressing either firefly luciferase or beta-D-glucuronidase. <p>
Build the expression system by clicking on a DNA segment and dragging it into the proper location on the outline of the DNA strand in the upper portion of the frame.
