Aldehyde reductase is an essential <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('enzyme.html');return false;">enzyme</a> found in large amounts in the kidney, liver, and <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('thyroid.html');return false;">thyroid</a>. It is needed to break down metabolic waste products and toxins. In addition, it is involved in the conversion and synthesis of biological <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('molecules.html');return false;">molecules</a>. The enzyme reduces the aldehyde <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('functionalgroup.html');return false;">functional group</a> into an alcohol functional group.  The enzyme is composed of two <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('protein.html');return false;">protein</a> subunits found in tandem. Tandem <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('genes.html');return false;">genes</a> are located near each other and share the same promoter.<p>
You will be doing a series of experiments to determine the utility of the aldehyde reductase promoter in genetic engineering. This inquiry is based on the finding of several researchers who discovered that the promoter is able to express eukaryotic tandem genes without causing problems. Potential problems would include the improper expression of downstream genes (the genes farthest from the promoter). In addition, some researchers discovered that, unlike some promoters, the aldehyde reductase promoter does not stop working after being used to regularly express tandem genes. This phenomenon is called gene silencing.<p>
The goal of your research is to see if the aldehyde reductase promoter will be useful for expressing two proteins equally using one enhancer molecule.<p>
