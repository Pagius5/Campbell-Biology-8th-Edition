You have read about the intricacies of the eukaryotic <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('gene.html');return false;">gene</a>.  Recent findings in animal and plant studies are showing more complexities to the control and regulation of eukaryotic genetics. With this knowledge, scientists are able to understand the development and diversity of organisms as well as genetic diseases.  In addition, this knowledge provides scientists with opportunities to create new gene combinations giving animals and plants novel traits having agricultural and commercial importance.<p>
In this investigation, you will study the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('promoter.html');return false;">promoter</a> from a segment of animal <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('dna.html');return false;">DNA</a> known to code for two tandem <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('proteins.html');return false;">proteins</a> that construct an <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('enzyme.html');return false;">enzyme</a> called aldehyde reductase.  Click on the picture of the DNA for more information about this gene.
