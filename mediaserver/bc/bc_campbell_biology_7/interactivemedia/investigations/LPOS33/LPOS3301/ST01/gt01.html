Insects are the most abundant animals on Earth, found in virtually every terrestrial habitat and climate. Of the 1.5 million described species in the world, more than 90 percent are insects.<p>
Most insect orders have two pairs of wings. The second pair are membranous. Mouthparts are the most diagnostic character for identifying insect orders. For example, beetles have biting mouthparts, while butterflies have sucking mouthparts.<p>
To identify insects, biologists usually rely on a dichotomous key, a set of descriptions arranged in successive choices. In this investigation, you will use a dichotomous key to identify four insects. Click to choose your first insect.
