Plants possess a wealth of chemicals that may have future value for humans. A host of plants produce chemicals with <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('insecticide.html');return false;">insecticide</a> properties. Many of these chemicals work by disturbing the fertility of the female insect. Scientists recently discovered a series of plant compounds that reduce the number of offspring in female insects feeding on the plant. Further investigation indicated that the compound produces effects resembling the bicoid <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('mutation.html');return false;">mutation</a>. Let's conduct an experiment similar to the one we just performed to investigate the action of this plant compound.<p>
In this experiment let's test to see the effects of the plant compound on normal fly development.<p>
Click on the anterior end of the normal early embryo to inject an extract from the plant.
