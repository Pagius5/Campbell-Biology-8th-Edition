Pharmacokinetics is the study of how a drug is transported through the body.  The electrical charge and <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('functionalgroups.html');return false;">functional groups</a> of a drug <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('molecule.html');return false;">molecule</a> can determine its ability to be transported to the affected parts of the body before being removed. Removal of a drug by the body, or drug clearance, is primarily done by the liver, where <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('enzymes.html');return false;">enzymes</a> break down the drug and diminish its effect. Drugs are also removed by the kidneys.<p>
