Some drugs come from natural sources such as animals, microorganisms, and plants. Others are synthesized from organic chemicals or produced by genetic engineering.<p>
Synthesized drugs are often mixtures of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('enantiomers.html');return false;">enantiomers</a>. For example, the synthesized antidepressant drug reboxetine is a mixture of two enantiomers: R,R and S,S. The R,R enantiomer has a stronger effect than the S,S form.<p>
Consider the following scenario: A research group in a pharmaceutical company is testing two potential alternatives to synthesized reboxetine. One alternative is naturally produced by a plant. The other is produced by a genetically engineered <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('yeast.html');return false;">yeast</a>.  Chemical analysis determines that both have the same chemical formula as synthesized reboxetine, and experiments on rats reveal no additional side effects. The research group has received government approval to conduct trials on humans.<p>
The trials take place over a six-month period and involve four groups of patients. Each group consists of 40 people who have been diagnosed with depression and who had previously been treated with synthesized reboxetine.<p>
