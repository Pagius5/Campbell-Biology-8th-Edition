Study the bar graph to compare the results for the groups.<p>
Key to results:<p>
NE &ndash; No effect on depression<br>
NES &ndash; No effect on depression, with side effects<br>
SE &ndash; Same effect as synthesized reboxetine<br>
SES &ndash; Same effect as synthesized reboxetine, with side effects<br>
GE &ndash; Greater effect than synthesized reboxetine<br>
GES &ndash; Greater effect than synthesized reboxetine, with side effects<br>
LE&ndash; Less effect than synthesized reboxetine<br>
LES&ndash; Less effect than synthesized reboxetine, with side effects<p>
Use the background information on <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('enantiomers.html');return false;">enantiomers</a> to hypothesize an explanation for the differences in results for groups A, B, and C.  Use your hypothesis to answer Question 8.<p>
Use the background information on pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacogenetics to answer Question 9.<p>
