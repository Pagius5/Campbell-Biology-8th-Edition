This investigation simulates an isometric, or fixed-length, contraction of an isolated <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('skeletalmuscle.html');return false;">skeletal muscle</a>. You will examine how the strength and frequency of an electrical stimulus affects whole muscle function. These simulations involve indirect stimulation by an electrode placed on the surface of the muscle. This differs from the situation in vivo where each fiber in the muscle receives direct stimulation via a nerve ending. In other words, increasing the intensity of the electrical stimulation mimics how the nervous system increases the number of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('motorunit.html');return false;">motor units</a> activated.<p>
How does stimulus intensity relate to the amount of force generated by the muscle? First, keep the muscle length at 75 mm, set the voltage to 0.0, and click Stimulate. Note the tracing on the oscilloscope. Click Record Data to save your data in the chart below. Increase the voltage by 0.5 each time until you reach the maximum voltage of 10.0. Be sure to click Record Data each time. Note the Active force and Passive force display. Active force is produced during muscle contraction, while passive force results from the muscle being stretched. The total force is the sum of active and passive forces.<p>
After each stimulus, you can click the Measure button at the right to display an orange vertical line on the oscilloscope. Clicking the arrow buttons below the Measure button moves the orange line horizontally so you can easily read the data. Click Clear Tracings to erase all tracings from the oscilloscope display. If you want to change the scale of the time axis before beginning a series of electrical stimulations, you can move the 200 button on the horizontal axis of the oscilloscope.<p>
After your experimentation, click on the Questions window and answer Questions 1 to 4.
