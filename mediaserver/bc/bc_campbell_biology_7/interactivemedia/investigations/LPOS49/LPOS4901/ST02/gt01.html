As demonstrated in the previous experiment with a single stimulus, multiple motor unit summation is one way to increase the amount of force produced by muscle. Multiple motor unit summation relies on increased stimulus intensity (higher voltage) in that experiment.<p>
Another way to increase force is by temporal summation. Temporal summation is achieved by increasing the stimulus frequency, or rate of stimulus delivery to the muscle. Temporal summation occurs because the muscle is already in a partially contracted state when subsequent stimuli are delivered. <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('tetanus.html');return false;">Tetanus</a> can be considered an extreme form of temporal summation that results in a steady, sustained contraction. In effect, the muscle does not have any chance to relax because it is being stimulated at such a high frequency. In this experiment, you will investigate temporal summation with multiple stimuli.<p>
1. Set the muscle length at 75 mm and the voltage at the maximal stimulus of 8.2 volts. Click Single Stimulus and then click Single Stimulus again when the muscle has relaxed about halfway. Then answer Question 5.<p>
2. Try stimulating again at greater frequencies by clicking the Single Stimulus button several times in rapid succession. Then answer Questions 6 and 7.<p>
3. Lower the voltage and click Single Stimulus again in rapid succession. Then answer Question 8.<p>
Use the concepts of motor unit summation and stimulus frequency to answer Question 9.
