Ecologists use a diversity index (H) to represent the diversity and species richness of organisms in an environment. The higher the absolute value of H, the greater the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('biodiversity.html');return false;">biodiversity</a>. Species richness is the number of different types of organisms in an environment. Species richness and the diversity index together provide a way to analyze the health of an ecosystem. The H formula used here is the Shannon-Weiner Index, which measures both species richness and evenness. The value of H' increases as richness and evenness increase. The formula is:  H<sup>1</sup>  =  - (P<sub>i</sub>) (log P<sub>i</sub>), where P<sub>i</sub> = the number of individuals of species i &#247; the total number of individuals in the community.<p>
 In this investigation, you will use species richness and diversity to measure the impact of human activities on species in rivers. You will be comparing species diversity in a river not located near human activities with species diversity in rivers near a farm and near a factory. The analysis will be simplified, involving just one sampling from each environment. Keep in mind that an actual analysis at a field site would require many samplings taken during different seasons and in varying conditions, including drought.<p>
First click on the button labeled "Initial diversity analysis" to look at the species richness and diversity for a similar river not located near human activities. Click on the Lab Notebook and record the number of organisms, proportion of population, and species index. Then close the Field Notes and click on each river to investigate its current diversity index.
