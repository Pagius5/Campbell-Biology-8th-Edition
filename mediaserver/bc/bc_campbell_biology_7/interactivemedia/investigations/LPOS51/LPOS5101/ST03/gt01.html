In a controlled experiment, you must explicitly keep all variables constant except the one you are manipulating. For instance, if you want to test response to wet vs. dry conditions, the light, temperature, chemicals in the filter paper or on the dish surface, and movement of the table must all remain constant. In addition, all the experimental organisms must be of the same approximate age, size, and state of health.
