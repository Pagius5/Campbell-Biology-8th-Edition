Scientists study behavior and other aspects of organisms through observation and controlled experiments. Consider the example of an experiment to observe how pillbugs respond to their environment. Pillbugs are crustaceans, and they respire through gills. In this experiment, 10 pillbugs are placed in a chamber, half in the side lined with dry filter paper and the other half in the side lined with wet filter paper.
