As you have seen, blood pressure is a measure of the pressure of the blood against the walls of a blood vessel. Clinically, blood pressure is usually measured in the brachial (arm) artery, so our discussion will focus on this specific location.<p>
There are two components to blood pressure:<p>
(1) Systolic pressure: The pressure in the artery during the ventricular contraction phase of the heart cycle. The pressure in the vessel is highest at this time.<p>
(2) Diastolic pressure: The pressure in the artery when the ventricles are relaxed. The pressure is at its lowest point, though it does not drop all the way to zero.<p>
