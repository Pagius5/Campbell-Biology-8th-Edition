We find the blood pressure by using an instrument called a sphygmomanometer (pronounced sfig-mo-muh-NAM-eh-ter). This device consists of an inflatable cuff that is wrapped around the upper arm and a gauge that measures pressure. A stethoscope is used to listen to the different sounds that occur.<p>
When we measure blood pressure, we are actually measuring the systolic pressure and the diastolic pressure separately. This is why you always see blood pressure reported as two numbers, one "over" the other. In a blood pressure reading of 110/80, for example,110 is the systolic pressure and 80 is the diastolic pressure. The numbers refer to the number of millimeters the pressure will raise a column of mercury. The blood pressure of teenagers is frequently in the range of 120/70.<p>
The American Heart Association defines high blood pressure, or hypertension, in an adult as a systolic pressure of 140 or higher and/or a diastolic pressure of 90 or higher. Diagnosis of high blood pressure is based on averaging two or more readings taken at each of two or more visits after an initial screening. Normal blood pressure for adults is a systolic pressure of less than 130 and a diastolic pressure of less than 85.<p>
