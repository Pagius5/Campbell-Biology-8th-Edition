The image at left shows ribosomes from mammalian (red) and bacterial (blue) sources. Ribosome sizes were originally measured in Svedberg units (S), by how fast they sedimented in a high-speed centrifugal field. By that measure, mammalian ribosomes are 80S and bacterial ribosomes are 70S.These images were created by a three-dimensional reconstruction technique. TEMs are collected in pairs, with and without tilt of the specimen grid. Micrographs are digitized, and a stereo image is generated from the paired images. Up to several thousand projections are used to gather enough information for images such as these. The colors chosen are purely arbitrary; the wavelengths of electrons are far outside the wavelengths of light, so electron micrographs have no inherent color.18. Estimate the size of an 80S and a 70S ribosome and record your estimates in your Lab Notebook.19. Answer Questions 11 and 12.20. Click on button 7.
