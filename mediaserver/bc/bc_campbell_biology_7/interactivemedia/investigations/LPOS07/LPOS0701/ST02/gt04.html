The image at left is a space-filling model of a lysozyme, a small protein molecule. The model uses balls to represent atoms, with the following color code:-- White = carbon-- Blue = nitrogen-- Red = oxygen-- Yellow = sulfur-- Green = phosphorusLysozyme was discovered in 1922 by Alexander Fleming, the Scottish bacteriologist who also discovered penicillin. Fleming had a cold, and noticed that when a few drops of his nasal secretions fell on a culture plate containing bacteria, nearby bacteria were dissolved (lysed). Fleming isolated the enzyme responsible and called it lysozyme, from the roots lyso (lysis) and zyme (a common name for enzymes in the 1920s).Lysozyme is present in all our secretions -- tears, saliva, mucus, etc. -- and is part of our innate defensive system against bacterial infections.9. Estimate the size of the lysozyme molecule and record your estimate in your Lab Notebook.10. Answer Question 8.11. Click on button 4.
