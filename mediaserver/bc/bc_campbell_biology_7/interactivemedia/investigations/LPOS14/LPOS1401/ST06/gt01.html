Each group of three nucleotides in DNA encodes an amino acid. Examine the amino acid sequence for the huntingtin protein found in a healthy person. Each letter corresponds to a different amino acid. Notice that in most of the huntingtin protein amino acids seem to follow each other more or less randomly, as in the line beginning with amino acid 121.<p>
But in the first two lines of the sequence, the amino acid represented by the letter Q (glutamine) is repeated 23 times, and the amino acid represented by P (proline) is repeated 10 times in two different places.<p>
What might this suggest about how the mutation that causes Huntington's disease alters the protein? Answer Question 5.
