Since the normal and disease <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('alleles.html');return false;">alleles</a> of the HD gene differ in the number of copies of the CAG repeat (glutamine, or "Q"), if we could detect that difference, we could identify people who have or will get the disease.<p>
But how can we detect that difference? Enzymes called <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('restrictionenzymes.html');return false;">restriction enzymes</a> cut DNA molecules at specific DNA sequences. For example, one enzyme called AluI (pronounced "a'-loo one") cuts the sequence AGCT wherever it occurs. AluI cuts this sequence between the G and the C, straight through both DNA strands. For example, in the sequence below, the enzyme would find the AGCT sequence and cut between the G and the C.<p>

1. The normal sequence at top left is a strand of the portion of the HD gene surrounding the CAG repeat. Each letter represents a base pair by standing for one of the nitrogenous bases in that pair. For example, C represents cytosine paired with guanine. Each line includes 70 base pairs (abbreviated "bp"), with the first line consisting of base pairs 211 through 280. Look through the normal sequence and find the two AGCT sequences where the AluI enzyme cuts. Count the number of base pairs between the two cut sites and record this data in your Lab Notebook. (It may be useful to print this page and count on paper.) <p>
2. Compare the normal sequence with the mutant, disease-causing sequence. The sites at which AluI cuts the mutant alternative of the HD gene are shown at left. Count the number of base pairs between the two cut sites and record this data in your Lab Notebook.<p>
3. Answer Questions 8 and 9.
