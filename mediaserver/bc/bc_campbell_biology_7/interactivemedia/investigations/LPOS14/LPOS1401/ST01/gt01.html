Like detectives, doctors are often faced with conditions they have never encountered before. They must apply the methods of science to diagnose their patients' illnesses. Acting as a research physician and medical sleuth, you will investigate a patient's condition by posing questions, analyzing experiments to test hypotheses, and designing procedures to diagnose it.<p>
Mrs. B., a 65-year-old woman, is brought to your office by her adult children. They tell you the following symptoms:<p>
 - Mrs. B. developed brief muscle twitches shortly after a fall that broke her right arm. These twitches did not interfere with her daily activities, but she retired from her job as an accountant at age 62. She had been making occasional errors at work, though she did not seem to have much trouble thinking and reasoning at that time.<br>
 - Over the past few years, Mrs. B.'s behavior has changed substantially. Her children say that she is often depressed and moody; she shows uncharacteristic outbursts of anger; she is often confused; and her twitches have become more persistent.<p>
You take a video of Mrs. B. for closer observation.<p>
