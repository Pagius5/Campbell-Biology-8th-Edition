It's time for your diagnosis. From your study of Mrs. B.'s symptoms and your finding that this condition is inherited as a dominant <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('trait.html');return false;">trait</a>, you conclude that Mrs. B has <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('huntingtonsdisease.html');return false;">Huntington's disease</a> (HD), a condition first described by George Huntington, a physician in New York, in 1872.<p>
But there is still more to investigate. Given Mrs. B.'s behavioral changes, you suspect that her brain may be affected. To find out, you take a PET (positron emission tomography) scan, which enables physicians to determine patterns of blood flow in various organs, especially the brain and heart, without invading the body. <p>
1. Examine the PET scans at left &#151; one is the brain of a healthy older person; the other is of Mrs. B.'s brain. <p>
2. Compare the two scans and record your observations in your Lab Notebook. How do the brain scans differ? <p>
3. Use your Lab Notebook to note specific differences in the anatomy of the two brains. <p>
 - Can you see a noticeable size difference in the large, white, X-shaped structure at the center of each brain? This structure is one of the brain's ventricles, or spaces, called the caudate body. <br>
 - Another area, called the caudate nucleus, mediates among various sensory systems and many motor responses that affect muscle movements, emotions, and some cognitive (thinking) behaviors. The caudate nucleus is smaller in Mrs. B.'s brain than in the healthy brain. This is difficult to see; it appears as a white cloud nestled into the sides of the large, white, central X.<p>
4. Using what you now know about brain anatomy, answer Question 3.
