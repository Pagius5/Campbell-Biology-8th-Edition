By looking at gene sequences, scientists can learn more about the function of genes and their protein products. A sequence might even give a clue as to how a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('mutation.html');return false;">mutation</a> might cause a disease.<p>
Several groups of biologists searched for the HD gene to determine the location on one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes. They isolated the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('dna.html');return false;">DNA</a> for the HD gene from chromosome 4, band 16.3, and determined the gene's sequence. The images at left show chromosome 4 and part of its DNA sequence.<p>
Examine the DNA sequence. It is the sequence of the HD gene, or of huntingtin, the protein made by the normal allele of the HD gene. (Remember that each strand is a string of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('nucleotides.html');return false;">nucleotides</a>, the subunits of DNA. There are 4 types of nucleotides in DNA, called A, C, G, and T.)  The top strand is the one that encodes the protein made by the gene. It is at nucleotide 315 in the first sequence. This is the portion of DNA for the initial parts of the protein encoded by the Huntington's disease gene.<p>
 The sequence is stored in a public database called GenBank at <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/GenbankOverview.html" target= "_blank">
