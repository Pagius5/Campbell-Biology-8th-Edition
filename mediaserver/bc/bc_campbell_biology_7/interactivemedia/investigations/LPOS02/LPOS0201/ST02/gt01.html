In this theoretical activity, you will analyze three rocks collected from recent space travels. Elemental analysis studies such as this are carried out to determine the elemental composition of space rocks.  These analyses allow astronomers to determine the rock's origin and formation.  This information provides clues to the creation of planets, solar systems, and the universe.  Recently, elemental studies on small rock fragments are hinting to the presence of life.<p>
To begin this investigation, you first need to know that erosion patterns on the rocks indicate they were at one time surface rocks from planets within our galaxy.  Now click on Rock 1 to investigate the elemental analysis of the specimen.<p>
Proceed to the next step when you are done recording the average elemental composition for each rock.
