Rock 2 has uneven characteristics on the surface. Five samples were taken from the rock for elemental analysis.<p>
The data represents the relative abundance of each element by percentage of weight.  Note that the numbers do not equal 100% because minor elements were left out. Click on the "Record Data" button for Rock 2 in your Lab Notebook to see the averages of the samples. At the bottom of the "Rock 2" column, make any notes about the uniformity of the elemental analysis of each sample. Then click "Return to Rock Samples" and select Rock 3.
