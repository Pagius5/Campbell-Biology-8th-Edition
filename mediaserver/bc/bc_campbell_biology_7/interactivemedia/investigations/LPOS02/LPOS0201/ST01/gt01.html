Life on earth is represented by a splendid diversity of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('organisms.html');return false;">organisms</a> ranging from undetectable viruses to tremendous pines and strange deep sea fishes. This diversity represents a long line of evolution that started when life first appeared on Earth.  A combination of geological events and biological interactions produced the life seen on Earth today.<p>
Scientists have speculated that there are at least 10,000 solar systems in our Milky Way that have the right conditions to harbor life with the complexity of ours.  Many other planets may contain simple life forms not readily recognizable.<p>
Astronomers are currently analyzing rocks from other planets collected in space and on the Earth for probable life. When looking for life, they rely on elemental analyses of the space material.  No matter what planet we are studying they all share the same 92 naturally occurring <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('elements.html');return false;">elements</a> provided by the universe.  However, a particular array and proportion of certain elements give evidence for the presence of living organisms.  In this activity we will investigate the elemental composition of several space materials to evaluate the probability of living matter on the object. One problem with doing this is that any organism collected on space material is probably dead if collected from specimens that have traveled in space.<p>
As you learned in Chapter 1, it is possible to distinguish living from dead organisms using a series of established characteristics.  Think about the probable elemental differences between living organisms and ones that have been dead for a long period of time. Then click on the Questions window and answer Question 1. Then click Next.
