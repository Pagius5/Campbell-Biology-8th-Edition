You've now seen that cell division is a dynamic event. Once you know the approximate duration of a particular cell cycle, it's possible to calculate the amount of time the cell spends in each phase. You can do this even though you are looking at a slide of cells that have been arrested in the process of division.<p>
Follow these steps to analyze the onion root tip cells in the slide at the left: <p>
1. Determine the approximate duration of the entire 
cycle for the cells you are studying. In this specimen, the average time for onion root tip cells to complete the cell cycle is 24 hours, or 1440 minutes.<br>
2. Looking at the slide, count and record the number of cells in the field of view that are in each phase. (In lab, you would count at least 200 cells by moving your slide so that you view several fields.) Click on the Lab Notebook to record your observation.<br>
3. Determine the total number of cells counted. Enter this number in your Lab Notebook.<br>
4. Determine the percent of cells that are in each phase. Enter this data in your Lab Notebook.<br>
5. To calculate the time (in minutes) for each phase, multiply the percent of cells in that phase by the number of minutes for the whole cycle. Record the results in your Lab Notebook and answer the Questions.
