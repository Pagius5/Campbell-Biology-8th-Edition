Most of the cell cycle is spent in <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('interphase.html');return false;">interphase</a>. During interphase the cell is growing and metabolic activity is very high. Toward the end of interphase, new DNA is synthesized and the chromosomes are replicated. Each chromosome of the homologous pair is then composed of two sister chromatids. Click on the Homologous Chromosomes button to learn more about them.<br><br>To learn about other phases of the cell cycle, return to the cell cycle by clicking on the small cell cycle icon.
