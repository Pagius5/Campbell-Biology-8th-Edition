Primary production is a term used to describe the rate at which plants and other photosynthetic organisms produce organic compounds in an ecosystem. There are two aspects of primary production:<ul>
<li> Gross primary production = the entire photosynthetic production of organic compounds in an ecosystem.<br>
<li> Net primary production = the organic materials that remain after photosynthetic organisms in the ecosystem have used some of these compounds for their cellular energy needs (cellular respiration).</ul><br>

Since oxygen is one of the most easily measured products of both photosynthesis and respiration, a good way to gauge primary production in an aquatic ecosystem is to measure dissolved oxygen. We cannot measure gross primary production directly because respiration, which uses up oxygen and organic compounds, is always occurring simultaneously with photosynthesis. However, we can measure it indirectly.<ul>
<li> We can measure net primary production directly by measuring oxygen production in the light, when photosynthesis is occurring.<br>
<li> We can also measure respiration without photosynthesis by measuring O<sub>2</sub> consumption in the dark, when photosynthesis does not occur.<br>
<li> Since net primary production equals gross primary production minus respiration, we can calculate gross primary production.
</ul>
