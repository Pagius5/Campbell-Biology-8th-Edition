A biology student inadvertently removed all the screens and labels from the bottles before measuring the amount of dissolved oxygen. When testing the unidentified bottles, the student obtained the results shown.<p>
The initial oxygen reading was 4 mg O<sub>2</sub>/l. Click on the Lab Notebook window. Based on the results predicted by the hypothesis that light increases production, follow these steps to complete the Lab Notebook:<p>
1. Put the bottles in order from least to most oxygen. The 0% bottle will be the one that has the least oxygen. The 100% light bottle will have the most oxygen. If you do this correctly, bottle C got 10% light.<p>
2. Calculate gross primary production. Remember that the bottle with 0% light is the dark bottle. It has 1 mg O<sub>2</sub>/l. The light bottle is the bottle for which you are trying to figure production. To calculate gross primary production, you subtract the % O<sub>2</sub> in the dark bottle from the % O<sub>2</sub> in the light bottle. Let's do the 10% light bottle as an example.<p>
Gross primary production = 3 mg O<sub>2</sub>/l - 1 mg O<sub>2</sub>/l = 2 mg O<sub>2</sub>/1<p>
3. Calculate net primary production. Again, the light bottle is the one you are doing the calculation for, and you are given the value for the initial bottle as 4 mg O<sub>2</sub>/l. To calculate net productivity you subtract the % O<sub>2</sub> in the initial bottle from the % O<sub>2</sub> in the light bottle. Let's do this for the 10% light bottle again:<p>
Net primary production = 3 mg O<sub>2</sub>/l - 4 mg O<sub>2</sub>/l = -1 mg O<sub>2</sub>/l<p>
After entering all the data, click on the "Graph Data" button. Use the graph to answer Question 4.
