Primary production is a term used to describe the rate at which plants and other photosynthetic organisms produce organic compounds in an ecosystem. To understand effects on primary production, you need to recognize factors that influence availability of oxygen. Oxygen is essential for cellular respiration in most organisms. In an aquatic environment, oxygen availability is influenced by a variety of chemical and physical factors.<p>
Some of the factors that affect the amount of oxygen dissolved in water are:<ul>
<li> Temperature: As water becomes warmer, its ability to hold oxygen decreases.<br>
<li> Photosynthetic activity: In bright light, aquatic plants are able to produce more oxygen.<br>
<li> Decomposition activity: As organic material decays, microbial processes consume oxygen.<br>
<li> Mixing and turbulence: Wave action, waterfalls, and rapids all aerate water and increase the oxygen concentration.<br>
<li> Salinity: As water becomes more salty, its ability to hold oxygen decreases.</ul><br>
