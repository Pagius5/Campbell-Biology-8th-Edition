This experiment monitors the effect of varying light levels on dissolved oxygen (DO) in an algae-rich water culture.<p>
The amount of light available for photosynthesis drops off sharply with increasing depth in an aquatic environment. This condition is modeled by wrapping water-sample bottles with increasing layers of screen, with one bottle being wrapped in foil to block all light.
