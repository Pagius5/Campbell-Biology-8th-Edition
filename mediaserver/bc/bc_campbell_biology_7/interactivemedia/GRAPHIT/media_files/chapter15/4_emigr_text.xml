<P>Now let's look at extinction.</P>
<P>The graph at left shows that extinction rate increases as the number of species increases.  This reflects the idea that species should have a harder time surviving as an island becomes more crowded and there is more competition for resources.</P>
<P>Move the slide-bar to the left and right and notice how the curve changes.</P>
<P>As with immigration rates, the theory assumes that this curve is fixed for a particular island, but varies between islands.  For example, overall extinction rates should be lower for large islands and higher for small islands.  One reason for this is that larger islands should have more resources and more habitiat variability, thus supporting a larger number of species.</P>
