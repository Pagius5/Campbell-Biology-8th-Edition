<P>The large range in sizes of Caribbean islands caused some problems for plotting the data in Step 1. This is because the island size data spans many "orders of magnitude."</P>
<P>A value is one order of magnitude greater than another value when it is roughly ten times greater.  For example, $20 is an order of magnitude greater that $2.  $2000 is two orders of magnitude greater than $20.</P>
<P>Test your understanding of orders of magnitude.  Line up the items by increasing order of magnitude of cost by dragging and dropping them to the boxes.  Then answer the question below.</P>
