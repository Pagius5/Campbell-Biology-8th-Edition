<P>The graph at left uses a logarithmic scale for both the island size, on the X-axis, and the number of species, on the Y-axis.</P>
<P>Press "Show log plot" to see the data set plotted on a log scale.</P>
<P>Notice that the data points are more spread out on this log plot and that it is easier to see the close relationship between island size and number of species.  Press on "Show standard plot" to compare the log plot with your graph from Step 1.</P>
<P>Answer questions 2 and 3 in the assignment.</P>
<P>When you are ready, proceed to Step 4.</P>
