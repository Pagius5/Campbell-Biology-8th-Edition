<P>Let's start by looking at immigration.</P>
<P>The graph at left shows that immigration rate decreases as the number of species increases.  This reflects the idea that it should be progressively harder for a new species to colonize the more species there already are on the island.</P>
<P>Move the slide-bar to the left and right and notice how the curve changes.</P>
<P>The equilibrium theory of island biogeography assumes that this curve is fixed for a particular island, but varies between islands.  For example, overall immigration rates should be lower for small islands and higher for large islands.  One reason for this is that larger islands are more likely to be discovered by migrating individuals.</P>
