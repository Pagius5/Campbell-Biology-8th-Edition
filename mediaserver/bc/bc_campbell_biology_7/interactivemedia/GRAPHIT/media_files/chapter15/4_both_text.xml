<P>The point where the immigration and extinction curves intersect is the number of species expected to be on the island.</P>
<P>When there are fewer species, immigration exceeds extinction and the number of species should increase.  When there are more species, extinction exceeds immigration and the number of species should decrease.</P>
<P>In other words, the intersection represents the equilibrium number of species on the island.</P>
<P>Modify the immigration and extinction rates, then move the vertical line over the intersection point to see the number of species expected to be on your hypothetical island.</P>
