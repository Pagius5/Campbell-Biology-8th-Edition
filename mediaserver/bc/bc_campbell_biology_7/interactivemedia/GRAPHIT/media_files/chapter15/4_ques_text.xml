<P>Use the sliders to make the immigration rate as low as possible and the extinction rate as high as possible.  Notice that the lines intersect at a low number of species.  This represents a small island.</P>
<P>As island size increases, the immigration rate is expected to increase and the extinction rate to decrease.  Examine the effect of increasing island size by progressively moving the immigration slider to the right and the extinction slider to the left.</P>
<P>Notice that the predicted number of species increases as you do this.  You have just demonstrated how the equilibrium theory of island biogeography predicts the species area effect observed for the Caribbean islands.</P>
<P>Answer questions 4 and 5 in the assignment.</P>
<P>When you have completed the assignment, you will be finished with this activity.</P>
