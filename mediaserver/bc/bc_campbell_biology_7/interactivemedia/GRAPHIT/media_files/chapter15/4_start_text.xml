<P>It makes sense that larger islands would have more species on them, but exactly why is this the case?  In an attempt to explain this observation, MacArthur and Wilson proposed the "equilibrium theory of island biogeography."</P>
<P>The equilibrium theory of island biogeography is expressed as a graphical model.  A graphical model does not represent real data.  Instead, it presents hypothetical relationships and suggests how the real world should behave if these relationships hold true.</P>
<P>In essence, the theory states that the number of species on an island is the result of a balance between immigration and extinction rates.  Immigration and extinction rates can be expected to vary with the characteristics of an island--for example, its size.  These differences in immigration and extinction rates should account for the observed number of species on different islands.</P>
