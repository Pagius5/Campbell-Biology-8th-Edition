	<P>The table at left contains data on the population growth of yeast grown in the laboratory.  The population was started by placing ten yeast cells in a sugar medium (this is hour 0).  The medium was then sampled each hour for the next 18 hours and the number of yeast cells counted.  Each row of the table represents one of these samples.</P>
