	<P>The table at left shows the density of snowshoe hares in eight large experimental field plots.  For each of these plots, the density of food (tree and shrub stems) is also shown.</P>
	<P>The values are in numbers per hectare; a hectare is a unit of ground area corresponding to 10,000 square meters.  Numbers of stems is in thousands; so the 25 in the first table row indicates 25,000 stems per hectare.</P>
	<P>Is there a relationship between food density and hare density?  Let's draw a graph and find out.</P>
