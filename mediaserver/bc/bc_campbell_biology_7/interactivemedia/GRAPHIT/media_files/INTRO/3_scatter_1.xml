	<P>Deer, as well as other animals living in northern climates, must survive winters during which food is scarce and conditions are harsh.  Does the severity of recent winters influence the population growth of deer?</P>
	<P>Snow accumulation is one measure of the severity of winter.  The table at left shows the change in the deer population during a particular year, along with the snow accumulation over the preceeding three years.</P>
	<P>The change in the deer population is measured as a proportion:</P>
	<P>[(# this year) - (# last year)] / (# last year)</P>
	<P>A positive value indicates that the population increased.  A negative value indicates a decrease.</P>
