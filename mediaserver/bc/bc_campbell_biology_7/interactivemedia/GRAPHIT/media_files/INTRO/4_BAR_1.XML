	<P>Rodent populations are typically monitored through live trapping.  Traps are set out before nightfall with some bait, and the unsuspecting rodent is caught by a harmless trap door.  If you set traps in different microhabitats, would you expect to capture a particular species equally in all those habitats?</P>
	<P>The table at left shows capture frequencies of the pocket mouse in four different microhabitats: large open spaces, small open spaces, beneath large bushes, and beneath trees.</P>
	<P>Capture frequencies reflect the proportion of times a pocket mouse was captured.  For example, a capture frequency of 0.1 would mean that a pocket mouse is captured in one out of every ten traps.</P>
