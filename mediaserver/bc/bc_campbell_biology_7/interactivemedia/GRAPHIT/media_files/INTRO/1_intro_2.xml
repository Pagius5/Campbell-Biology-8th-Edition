	<P>Data--like that shown in this table--forms the core of all scientific inquiry.  Scientists look for trends in data, then attempt to explain those trends.  These possible explanations lead to new experiments, which then lead to new discoveries and new questions.  Scientists use graphs to make it easier to see trends in data.</P>
	<P>Draw a graph of this data by pressing "Plot the Data."</P>
	<P>This graph is a line plot of the data set.  Each point represents one row of the table.  Roll your mouse over each point to see the data row it belongs to.</P>
	<P>The connecting lines allow you to visualize the trend in the data.</P>
