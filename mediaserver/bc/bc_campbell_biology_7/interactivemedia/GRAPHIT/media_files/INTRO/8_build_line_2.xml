	<P>Graphs are not only tools for finding trends in data.  They are also communication tools.  By modifying the scale of the X and Y axes, you can alter the visual impression made by a graph.</P>
	<P>Try various changes in scale.  For example, try 1940 to 2020 for the X-axis and 0 to 3 for the Y-axis.  For each change, ask yourself whether the change in stream flow seems more or less "dramatic."</P>
	<P>None of the changes in scale affect the basic information contained in the graph: stream flow dropped by roughly half during the period from 1966 to 1995.  Whenever you see a graph, you should look beyond its visual impression and determine the fundamental information it contains.</P>
