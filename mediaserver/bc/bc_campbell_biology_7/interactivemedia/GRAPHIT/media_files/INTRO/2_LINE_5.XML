	<P>That's right.</P>
	<P>The number of cells increased slowly in the first few hours, rapidly in the middle, and then nearly stopped increasing after 15 hours.</P>
	<P>This is a classic population growth curve known as a logistic curve.  Logistic growth is characterized by rapid initial growth, then slowed growth as the population meets environmental resistance.  In this case, alcohol produced by the yeast itself is halting the population growth.</P>
	<P>Many of the classic experiments in ecology involved bacteria, yeast, and protozoans grown in the laboratory.  These studies provided the early foundations for understanding population growth and how it is limited by scarce resources, competition, and predation.</P>
	<P>You have completed Step 2.  Please proceed to Step 3.</P>
