	<P>In 1883 the island of Krakatau experienced a violent volcanic eruption.  The island was destroyed and nearby islands were covered with ash.  All life was obliterated from these islands.  But what has happened since then?</P>
	<P>The table at left shows data that was collected over the hundred years following the eruption.  Each row shows a year and the number of species of birds that were observed on the islands that year.  See if you can find how many bird species were found in 1908.  What about 1950?</P>
