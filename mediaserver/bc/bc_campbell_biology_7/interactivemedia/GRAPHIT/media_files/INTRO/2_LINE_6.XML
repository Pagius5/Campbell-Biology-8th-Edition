	<P>Why are hours on the X-axis and number of cells on the Y-axis?  Why not the other way around? </P>
	<P>The number of cells changes as a result of the passage of time, or depends on the passage of time. The number of cells is the dependent variable. However, the change in the number of cells has no effect on time. Time is the independent variable.</P>
	<P>By convention, the dependent variable is placed on the Y-axis. The independent variable is placed on the X-axis.</P>
	<P>Select a button to see the dependent and independent variables.</P>
