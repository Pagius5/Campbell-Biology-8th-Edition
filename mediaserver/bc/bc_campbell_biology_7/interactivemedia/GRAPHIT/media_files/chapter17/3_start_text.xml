<P>By examining global oil production trends in light of Hubbert's Curve, it is possible to make an "educated guess" as to the future of global oil production.</P>
<P>The starting point is having an estimate of the total available oil.  The current estimate is 1750 billion barrels of oil.  The Hubbert's Curve on the graph at left--shown in blue--is based on this estimate.</P>
<P>Change the peak year by moving the slider bar left and right.  For what peak year does the curve best match the actual trend in oil production?  This represents your "guestimate" of the year in which global oil production will peak.</P>
<P>Answer question 3 in the assignment.  When you have finished, continue to the next screen.</P>
