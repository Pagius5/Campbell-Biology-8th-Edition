<P>The data will be plotted as a line graph.  A graph has already been created for you at left.  Years are on the X-axis and oil production rate on the Y-axis.</P>
<P>Plot the data by dragging the data points (green dots) to the correct location on the graph.</P>
<P>If you are having trouble, try finding the location along the X-axis first, then dragging the point upward until it is at the correct height along the Y-axis.</P>
