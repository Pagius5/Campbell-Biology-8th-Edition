<P>The graph at left shows "Hubbert's Curve."  This curve represents a theoretical prediction of how production of a nonrenewable resource should behave through time.</P>
<P>The essential assumption of Hubbert's Curve is that there is a fixed amount of resource available.  So, although production may grow rapidly at first, it must eventually peak and decline as the resource is depleted.</P>
<P>Using this curve, Hubbert accurately predicted the peak of U.S. oil production in 1970.</P>
<P>Click on each part of the curve--growing production, peak, and declining production--to learn more.</P>
<P>Answer question 2 in the assignment.  When you have finished, proceed to Step 3.</P>
