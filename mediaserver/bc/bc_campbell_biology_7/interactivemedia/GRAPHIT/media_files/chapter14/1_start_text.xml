<P>Fresh water is not distributed evenly across the Earth's surface.  Variation in precipitation--and in the distribution of rivers, lakes, and aquifers--results in large differences in water availability between regions and continents.</P>
<P>The table at left shows the estimated availability of fresh water by continent.  The values are 1000's of cubic kilometers per year.  This represents the total volume of fresh water available to that continent each year. </P>
