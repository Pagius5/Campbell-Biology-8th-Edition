<P>While differences in total water are instructive, what really matters is how much water is available for each person.  This type of measure is called "per capita."  It is essentially the total divided by the size of the population to which the total applies.</P>
<P>The table at left shows the fresh water available per capita for each continent.  The values are in 1000's of cubic meters per person per year.</P>
<P>The units are different for total water and water per capita.  To accomodate these two different units, there are two Y-axes.  The one on the right side of the graph represents water per capita.</P>
<P>Drag the bars to the correct location on the graph to plot the data.</P>
