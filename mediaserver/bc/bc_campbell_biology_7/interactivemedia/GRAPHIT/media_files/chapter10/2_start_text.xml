<P>Dose-response curves use a logarithmic scale along the X-axis.  Logarithmic (or "log") scales are used when you are representing values that span a very large range--more precisely, when they span many "orders of magnitude."</P>
<P>A value is one order of magnitude greater than another value when it is roughly ten times greater.  For example, $20 is an order of magnitude greater that $2.  $2000 is two orders of magnitude greater than $20.</P>
<P>Test your understanding of orders of magnitude.  Line up the items by increasing order of magnitude of cost by dragging and dropping them to the boxes.  Then answer the question below.</P>
