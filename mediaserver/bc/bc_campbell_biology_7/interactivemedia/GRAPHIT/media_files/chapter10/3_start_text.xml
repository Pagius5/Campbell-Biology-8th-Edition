<P>Imagine that an industrial solvent has been discovered as a contaminant in groundwater in a major metropolitan area.</P>
<P>A dose-response study is conducted to evaluate the toxicity of the contaminant.  Groups of laboratory mice are exposed to the contaminant in the concentrations listed in the table.</P>
<P>The test animals are monitored for toxic effects.  The table at left shows the percentage of test animals exhibiting toxic effects for each dose level.</P>
<P>Plot the data by dragging the data points (green dots) to the correct location on the graph.  If you are having trouble, try finding the location along the X-axis first, then dragging the point upward until it is at the correct height along the Y-axis.</P>
