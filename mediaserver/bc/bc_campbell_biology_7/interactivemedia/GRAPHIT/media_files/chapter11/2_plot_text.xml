<P>Data for carbon monoxide (CO) has been added to the table at left.</P>
<P>Because it can bind irreversibly to hemoglobin, interrupting the supply of oxygen to cells, CO is a dangerous air pollutant even in small concentrations.  Incomplete combustion of fuels is the primary source of carbon monoxide.</P>
<P>Inspect the emission data for CO.  How would you need to change the scale of this graph to add the CO data to it?</P>
