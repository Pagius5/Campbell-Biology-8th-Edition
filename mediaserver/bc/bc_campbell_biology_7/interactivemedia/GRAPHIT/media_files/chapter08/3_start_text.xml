<P>How badly is the world's soil degraded?  For example, more than 20% of Europe's usable land is degraded.  Has that land turned to desert, or something less dramatic?</P>
<P>The table at left shows the same data from Step 1 in greater detail by breaking it down into categories of degradation.  For example, "moderate degradation" means that agricultural productivity has been greatly reduced while "extreme degradation" means the soil is  beyond recovery.</P>
<P>Press "Plot the Data" to draw a graph of this data set.</P>
<P>When you are ready, answer questions 5 and 6 in the assignment.</P>
<P>When you have answered the questions, you will be finished with this activity.</P>
