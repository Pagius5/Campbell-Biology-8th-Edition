<P>Two new lines have been added to this graph for "fully developed" and "senescent" fisheries (columns C and D, respectively).</P>
<P>A fishery that has been fully explored and is being harvested to its maximum capacity is considered fully developed.  Catches stop growing and become stagnant.</P>
<P>Eventually, if a fishery is harvested intensely over an extended period, catches begin to decline and the fishery is considered senescent.  This is overfishing.</P>
<P>Answer questions 3 and 4 in the assignment.</P>
<P>When you have finished, proceed to Step 4.</P>
