<P>A "fishery" is a relatively isolated population of fish that is harvested for human use.  For example, Atlantic cod in the Grand Banks off of Newfoundland represents an important North Atlantic fishery.</P>
<P>The growth of global fish capture in the 1900s was accomplished in part by the discovery of new, unexploited fisheries.</P>
<P>When a fishery is first discovered, it tends to produce low catches and is categorized as "undeveloped."  The table at left show the percentage of undeveloped fisheries over the last 50 years.</P>
