<P>The graph at left is called an "area plot."  It contains the same information as the graph in Step 3, just presented in a different fashion.</P>
<P>An area plot is drawn by adding the percentage of each column to the previous columns for each year.  The percentages for each year add up to 100, so the whole area of the graph is completely filled.</P>
<P>The area occupied by a particular stage (undeveloped, developing, etc.) gives a visual impression of the predominance of that stage during a particular year.  For example, you can quickly see that undeveloped fisheries comprised a large portion of all fisheries prior to 1964, but were not present after 1974.</P>
<P>Answer question 5 in the assignment.</P>
<P>When you are finished, proceed to Step 5.</P>
