<P>Total MSW generation represents the cumulative effect of millions of individuals producing a relatively small amount of trash.  The average amount of MSW generated by each individual in the U.S. is called the "per capita" MSW and is shown in the table at left.</P>
<P>Plot the data by dragging the data points (green dots) to the correct location on the graph.  Notice that the Y-axis for per capita MSW generation is along the right side of the graph.</P>
<P>If you are having trouble, try finding the location along the X-axis first, then dragging the point upward until it is at the correct height along the Y-axis.</P>
