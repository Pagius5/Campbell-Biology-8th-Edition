<P>Of course, the challenge of managing solid waste is that it has to go somewhere.</P>
<P>The table at left shows trends in MSW disposal since 1960.</P>
<P>Note that while recylcables and organic waste are considered part of the municipal solid waste stream, their recovery for use as raw material and compost means they don't contribute to landfills or need to be incinerated.</P>
<P>This data should be graphed as a line plot.  What scale would you use for the Y-axis to graph this data set?</P>
