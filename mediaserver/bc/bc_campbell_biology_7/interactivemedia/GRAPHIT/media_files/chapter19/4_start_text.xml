<P>The graph at left displays the same data as in Step 3, but in a different way.  Instead of plotting each column as separate lines, the value of each column is added to the previous columns going from left to right.  The result is called an area graph.</P>
<P>The four categories--landfill, combustion, recycling, and composting--account for all MSW.  Summing them for a year gives you the total MSW production for that year.  So the top of the area graph represents total MSW production for 1960 to 2000.</P>
<P>You may notice that this curve matches our previous curve for total MSW production from Steps 1 and 2--with the exception that this curve has more detail.  Go back and check.</P>
<P>Answer questions 6 and 7 in the assignment.  When you are done, you will have finished this activity.</P>
