<P>Most scientists agree that human activities are increasing the CO&lt;font size="-4"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt; content of the Earth's atmosphere.  The available evidence also suggests that this increasing concentration of CO&lt;font size="-4"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt; is causing an increase in average global temperatures--a phenomenon referred to as "global warming."</P>
<P>Charles Keeling, of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, has been monitoring atmospheric CO&lt;font size="-4"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt; concentrations since 1958.  This sampling is done on a monthly basis at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.</P>
<P>The table on the left shows the yearly average concentrations of CO&lt;font size="-4"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt; since 1964. In this activity, you will be plotting and interpreting this data.</P>
