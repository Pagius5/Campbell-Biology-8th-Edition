<P>A major challenge facing policy makers is predicting future changes in atmospheric CO&lt;font size="-4"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt; concentrations and the resulting climate change.</P>
<P>These predictions start with knowing CO&lt;font size="-4"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt; emission rates and projecting how they are likely to change in the future.</P>
<P>The year 1990 has been adopted as the conventional "baseline" year against which future changes are measured.  The table at the lower left shows the emissions of CO&lt;font size="-4"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt; in 1990 by various regions of the world.  The units are million metric tons (MMT) per year.</P>
