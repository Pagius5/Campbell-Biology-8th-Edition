<P>The three lines added to the graph represent three possible future trajectories for atmospheric CO&lt;font size="-4"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt; concentrations.  Each trajectory--labeled A, B, and C--corresponds to one of the hypothetical control scenarios.  Scientists and policy analysts generate projections such as this using computer simulation models.</P>
<P>Answer questions 5 through 7 in the assignment based on these emission control scenarios and projections.</P>
<P>When you have answered the questions, you will be finished with this activity.</P>
