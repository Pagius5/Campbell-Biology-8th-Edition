<P>That's right.  It would be very instructive to plot temperature changes together with atmospheric CO&lt;font size="-4"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt; concentration.</P>
<P>The table at left shows the observed increase in global surface temperatures between 1960 and 2000.  The temperature change is calculated relative to the average temperature observed between 1960 and 1990.  So the surface temperature observed in 1965 was 0.12 degrees C below this average.  The temperature observed in 1990 was 0.21 degrees C above this average.</P>
<P>Now plot the data by dragging the data points (green dots) to the correct location on the graph.  Notice that the Y-axis for temperature change is along the right side of the graph.</P>
<P>If you are having trouble, try finding the location along the X-axis first, then dragging the point upward until it is at the correct height along the Y-axis.</P>
