<P>Press the buttons to toggle between graphs of conversion efficiency and production efficiency.</P>
<P>Both graphs contain the same information, just presented in a different fashion. The graph of conversion efficiency is easier to interpret. For example, looking at the value for eggs, you can see that you get roughly 1/3 kilogram of eggs for every kilogram of feed consumed by the hens.</P>
<P>Answer questions 2 through 4 in the assignment based on these graphs.</P>
<P>When you have finished, proceed to Step 3.</P>
