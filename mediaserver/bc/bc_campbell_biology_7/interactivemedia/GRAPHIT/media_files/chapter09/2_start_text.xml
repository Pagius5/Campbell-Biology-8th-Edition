<P>Another way to think of efficiency is to ask the question, what is the percentage return for each kilogram of feed consumed by the animal?  This can be thought of as the conversion efficiency.</P>
<P>This conversion efficiency value can be calculated directly from the data we already have.  The conversion efficiency is 1 divided by the feed input per kilogram--which is then multiplied by 100 to obtain the percentage.</P>
<P>Using this rule, what is the percent conversion efficiency for chicken?</P>
