<P>All food production requires inputs.  Grain and vegetable production requires fertilization and irrigation.  Animal products require inputs of grain and water.</P>
<P>Different types of food have different production efficiencies.  Efficiency tells you how much input is required to achieve a unit of output.  This translates to the economic and environmental costs for producing the product.  Understanding the relative costs of producing various agricultural products is important in developing sound food policy.</P>
<P>The table at left lists the amount of feed (in kilograms) required to produce one kilogram of that food product.  In this activity, you will be graphing and interpreting this data set.</P>
