The <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('plasmamembrane.html');return false;">plasma membrane</a> of the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('neurons.html');return false;">neuron</a> keeps large negatively charged molecules such as proteins inside the cell. Pumps and channels in the membrane regulate the flow of positively charged sodium and potassium <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('ions.html');return false;">ions</a>. The neuron maintains a higher concentration of sodium ions outside the cell than inside and a higher concentration of potassium ions inside the cell than outside. In a resting neuron, most sodium channels are closed, but many potassium channels are open. As a result, very little sodium can diffuse into the cell, but potassium ions can flow freely out of the cell, adding to the positive charge outside. The <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('sodiumpotassiumpump.html');return false;">sodium-potassium pump</a> actively transports more sodium ions out of the cell than potassium ions into the cell. This contributes to the buildup of positive charge outside the cell while keeping the concentration of sodium low and the concentration of potassium high inside the cell. The diffusion of positive potassium ions out of the cell and the large, negatively charged molecules trapped inside the cell cause the charge difference that constitutes the resting potential.
