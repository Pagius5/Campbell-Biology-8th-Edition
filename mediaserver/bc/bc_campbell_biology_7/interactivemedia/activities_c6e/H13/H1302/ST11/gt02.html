Prophase I Answer: The duplicated homologous chromosomes pair up, and crossing-over occurs. At this point each homologous chromosome pair is visible as a tetrad, a tight grouping of four chromatids, two of them sisters and two of them non-sisters. The sites of crossing-over are seen as crisscrossed chromatids and are called chiasmata (singular: chiasma).
