At metaphase I, the chromosome tetrads are aligned on the metaphase plate. For each tetrad, kinetochore microtubules from one pole of the cell are attached to one homologous chromosome, while kinetochore microtubules from the other pole of the cell are attached to the other chromosome of the pair. Thus, the homologous chromosomes are poised to move to opposite poles of the cell.
