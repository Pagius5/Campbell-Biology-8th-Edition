It is estimated that every year one million children die due to vitamin A deficiency and another 350,000 go blind. Most of these children live in countries where their only food consists of one or two bowls of rice a day. In the late 1980s a Swiss plant scientist named Ingo Protrykus got the idea that perhaps rice could be genetically altered to produce beta-carotene, the precursor to vitamin A. This, he reasoned, would allow local farmers to grow a nutrient-enhanced rice which would prevent vitamin A deficiency. He enlisted the help of German biochemist Peter Beyer. After over ten years of work they announced success in 1999, and the world got its first look at the pale yellow rice grains colored by the beta-carotene contained within. We will examine a few scientific and moral/ethical concerns related to this technological achievement.
