The location of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('genes.html');return false;">genes</a> is designated by an established labeling system for <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('chromosomes.html');return false;">chromosomes</a>. Shown here is a drawing of human chromosome 17 showing its characteristic major banding pattern as it appears after staining. By convention, chromosomes are drawn with the short arm on top labeled p (for petit) and the long arm on the bottom labeled q (for queue).  To indicate the location of a gene on a particular chromosome, the chromosome number is followed by p or q and then a number that represents the band and sub-band.  For example 17p13.3 designates the p arm of chromosome 17, band 13, sub-band 3. In some cases only an approximate location is known so a range of numbers is given. The general locations of a few of these genes are shown using their standard abbreviations. Click on an abbreviation to find the gene's exact location and a brief description of the gene's function.
