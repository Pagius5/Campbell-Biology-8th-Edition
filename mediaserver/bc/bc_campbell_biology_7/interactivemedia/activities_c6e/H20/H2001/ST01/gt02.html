The popular stonewashed denim look is actually achieved by treating denim with cellulase <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('enzymes.html');return false;">enzymes</a> which partially break down the cotton fibers of the denim.  This gives stonewashed jeans their soft texture when compared to regular jeans.  (It also means they wear out faster than regular jeans.)   Many different cellulase enzymes have been discovered in microorganisms.  <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('recombinantdna.html');return false;">Recombinant DNA</a> technology is used to clone the genes encoding these enzymes so that large quantities of enzyme can be produced and sold to textile manufacturers.
