Insulin from an animal source, such as cows, pigs, or horses has traditionally been used to treat  diabetics.  Insulin from these animals is similar but not identical to human insulin.  Because of this, many patients develop allergic reactions. Recombinant DNA tools have enabled researchers to locate and clone the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('gene.html');return false;">gene</a> for human insulin, ensuring an ample supply of insulin that does not cause allergic reactions.
