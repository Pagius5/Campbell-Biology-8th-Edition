A bacterium is placed on a growth medium. It replicates the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('plasmid.html');return false;">plasmid</a> at the same time as its own DNA. Its descendants form a clone of bacteria that all have copies of the recombinant plasmid. The ampicillin in the medium limits growth only to plasmid-containing cells, but which cells have plasmids with a human <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('gene.html');return false;">gene</a>? Bacteria without human genes have intact lacZ genes; this allows them to break down a substance in the medium that stains their colonies blue. Thus, the bacteria with human genes are in the colorless colonies.
