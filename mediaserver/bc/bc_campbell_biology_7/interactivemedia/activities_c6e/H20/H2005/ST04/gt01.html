To determine the length of a fragment in DNA II, click on the orange band that represents the fragment. A line will be drawn from the distance the fragment traveled (on the x-axis) to the calibration curve. At the point that it intersects the calibration curve, another line will be drawn to the value for the length in base pairs of the fragment. To determine the length of the DNA fragments in DNA I, drag the ruler down until it is directly above DNA I. Click on each orange band in DNA I to measure the fragment's length in base pairs.<br><br> Which fragments travel the farthest-- the shortest fragments or the longest fragments?
