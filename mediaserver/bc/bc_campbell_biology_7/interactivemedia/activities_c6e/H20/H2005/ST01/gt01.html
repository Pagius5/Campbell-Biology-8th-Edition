Often, it is important to determine the length of each <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('dna.html');return false;">DNA</a> fragment on an electrophoresis. This may be easily done if a marker DNA sample is run alongside the experimental samples on the gel. The marker DNA sample contains a number of DNA molecules, each with a known molecular size. Molecular size is measured in terms of number of base pairs in a DNA fragment. Our marker DNA includes 8 DNA fragments that have 23130, 9416, 6557, 4361, 2322, 2027, 564, and 125 base pairs. (The 125 base pair fragment is often not seen in experiments, either because it is too faint or because it runs off the gel.) This illustration shows an example of a gel with this DNA marker and some "unknown" DNA samples (DNA I and DNA II).
