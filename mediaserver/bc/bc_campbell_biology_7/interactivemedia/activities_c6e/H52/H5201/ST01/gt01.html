For this activity, imagine that you are a wildlife biologist interested in studying the rare (and possibly endangered) white-footed Guano Island mouse. The mice were once widespread. Now they are known to live only on Guano Island, a tiny dot off the coast of Peru, with an area of only 50 hectares. Unlike many rodents, the Guano Island mice are not territorial; they hide during the day, but at night they roam freely over the island in search of thornbush seeds, their favorite food.
