Good choice. While it might be possible to count all the thornbushes on an island this small, the island is rugged and a total count would be a lot of work. The sample plot method involves counting all the organisms in selected plots of known size, then extrapolating to  estimate the size of the entire population. It is a relatively easy way to make a quick estimate of thornbush population density.
