The mark-recapture method is a sampling technique used for determining population density. Animals are trapped, marked, and released. Later, traps are set again, and the proportion of marked and unmarked animals captured during the second trapping gives an estimate of the size of the whole population. Thornbushes stay put, so you don't have to capture them. Try the sample plot method instead.
