The mark-recapture method is a sampling technique used for determining wildlife <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('population.html');return false;">population</a> density. Animals are trapped, marked, and released. Later, traps are set again, and the proportions of marked and unmarked animals captured during the second trapping gives an estimate of the size of the whole population. The mark-recapture method is a good choice for active, elusive creatures like mice.
