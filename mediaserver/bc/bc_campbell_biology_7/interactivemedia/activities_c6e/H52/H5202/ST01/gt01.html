Scientists make graphs called <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('survivorshipcurve.html');return false;">survivorship curves</a> to show patterns of mortality and survivorship in different species. There are three basic patterns. Some species produce many young but only a few survive to become reproductively active. Other species produce only a small number of young, but a large percentage of them survive to adulthood. Still other species are intermediate. Their mortality rate is fairly constant over the life span.
