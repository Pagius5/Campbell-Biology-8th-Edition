The <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('population.html');return false;">populations</a> of animals, plants, and other organisms in an ecosystem are determined by many environmental factors. Populations tend to reach a certain maximum level called the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('carryingcapacity.html');return false;">carrying capacity</a>.<p>Humans are in many ways subject to the same factors that affect the populations of other animals.

Click on one of the circles on the growth curve to investigate the environmental factors responsible for a pattern of rapid human population growth or decline during the time span from 1000 BC to AD 2100.
