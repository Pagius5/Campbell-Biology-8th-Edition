Why do we not see a carrying capacity cutoff for the human population? What factor is permitting the human population to remain in a seemingly endless growth pattern?<p>Further human population growth is being maintained by our ability to compress large populations into ever-expanding urban areas in addition to improvements in medicine. At our current rate of growth, we can expect to double our existing population of 6 billion people in 40 years. We may very soon learn our carrying capacity.<p>As we learned in this activity, humans are, in some ways, subject to the same population control factors as other organisms. However, our ability to avoid environmental constraints permits us to continuously increase our population. We may ultimately reach a decline in population growth as new diseases emerge or as we deplete resources from the environment making it difficult to obtain food. Famines and devastating disease outbreaks are already occurring in developing nations and are responsible for regional declines in population growth.
