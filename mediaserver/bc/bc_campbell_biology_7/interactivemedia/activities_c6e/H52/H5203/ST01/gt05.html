This burst in human population corresponds to the advent of modern medicine:<p>Modern medicine has had a great impact on sustaining the growth of the human population. Antibiotics and vaccines have had a significant impact on ensuring rapid growth of the human population.<p>Animals and plants can experience similar population booms when they are transported, often by humans, to new areas. If the organism survives the transition, its population can grow unchecked, because it has no natural diseases or predators. The kudzu plant of Japan has taken over some areas of the southern United States by outgrowing native plants. Nothing in the United States attacks or eats the kudzu. The Norway rat and the German cockroach were carried around the world during the 1600s and became virtually uncontrollable worldwide pests.
