The <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('polarity.html');return false;">polarity</a> of water <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('molecules.html');return false;">molecules</a> causes them to be attracted to each other. Since the positively charged atom involved in this special type of attraction is always a hydrogen atom, this kind of bond between molecules is called a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('hydrogenbond.html');return false;">hydrogen bond</a>. Each water molecule can hydrogen bond to four other water molecules. A hydrogen bond is weak and lasts only a tiny fraction of a second, but it takes a lot of energy to overcome the combined attraction of many hydrogen bonds. This explains water's great capacity to store heat, its high boiling point, <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('surfacetension.html');return false;">surface tension</a>, and several other unusual properties.
