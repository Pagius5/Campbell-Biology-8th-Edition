Because of this unequal sharing of electrons, the oxygen atom in a water molecule actually has a slight negative charge and each hydrogen atom has a slight positive charge, even though the water molecule as a whole is neutral. Because of the unequal sharing of electrons and the resulting positive and negative poles, the bonds between oxygen and hydrogen are called <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('polarcovalentbond.html');return false;">polar covalent bonds</a>, and a water molecule is said to be polar.
