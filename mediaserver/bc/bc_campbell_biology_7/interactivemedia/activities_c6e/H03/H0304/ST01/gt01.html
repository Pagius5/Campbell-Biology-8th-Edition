Sometimes water molecules break apart, or dissociate, into ions. Each water molecule splits into a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('hydrogenion.html');return false;">hydrogen ion</a>, H<sup>+</sup>, and a hydroxide ion, OH<sup>-</sup>. In pure water, the concentrations of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions are equal, as shown here. But the actual concentrations of these ions are drastically less than shown in the illustration. In pure water only about one water molecule in half a billion is dissociated, so don't take the illustration too literally.
