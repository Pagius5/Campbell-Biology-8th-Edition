The top equation summarizes the dissociation of water to form hydronium and hydroxide ions: H<sub>2</sub>O plus H<sub>2</sub>O gives H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup>. Although this equation is technically correct, it is most useful to think of this process as the dissociation of a single water molecule into a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('hydrogenion.html');return false;">hydrogen ion</a> and a hydroxide ion, as shown in the bottom equation: H<sub>2</sub>O yields H<sup>+</sup> plus OH<sup>-</sup>. The double arrows-- and the animation-- show that the dissociation of water is a reversible process. Hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions don't last very long on their own. In fact, a very small portion of the molecules in a glass of water are dissociated at any one time-- only about one water molecule in half a billion.
