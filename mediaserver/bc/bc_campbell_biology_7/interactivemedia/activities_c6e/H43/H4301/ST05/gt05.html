Complement fixation is the activation of a series of serum proteins, leading to lysis of a microbe. First, complement proteins bind to <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('antibodies.html');return false;">antibodies</a> that have tagged a foreign cell. Complement proteins can lyse any cell that has been tagged by IgM or IgG antibodies. Some of the complement proteins are activated to form a membrane attack complex that creates a pore in the target cell. The pore formed by the membrane attack complex allows ions and water to rush into the cell, causing the cell to swell and lyse.
