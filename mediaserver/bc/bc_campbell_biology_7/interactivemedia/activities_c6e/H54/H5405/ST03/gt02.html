Correct. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found in its recent National Water Quality Inventory that animal wastes and fertilizers were the main sources of pollution.  Most fertilizers contain nitrate, and both farmers and homeowners often use too much fertilizer, or fertilize just before it rains. In both cases, rainwater washes the nitrates into nearby rivers. Nitrate in water causes many problems.
