You can reduce water pollution by following the advice from your county agricultural extension offices, which provide tips for fertilizing your lawn and garden. Most of these tips are designed to reduce the amount of nitrate being washed into rivers. Some examples of easy ways to reduce water pollution include:<p>1) Test the soil before you fertilize to make sure that fertilizer is really necessary.<br>2) Do not fertilize just before heavy rain.<br>3) Use a mulching mower, or leave grass clippings on the lawn to encourage natural recycling of nitrate.<br>4) Sweep grass clippings off driveways and concrete surfaces, as these often wash into storm drains and then into rivers.<br>5) Use a slow-release fertilizer that will last for several months.<br>6) Do not fertilize close to streams, retention ponds, or rivers.<br>If you want to find out specifically about water pollution in your area, the EPA has a website where you can type in your zip code and find out about your <a href="http://www.epa.gov/surf3/locate/index.html" target="_blank">
