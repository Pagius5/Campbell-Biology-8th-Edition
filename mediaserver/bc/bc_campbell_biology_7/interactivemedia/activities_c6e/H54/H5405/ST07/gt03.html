Each state has its own programs to combat water pollution. One recent example in California is Proposition 12. In March 2000, voters approved Proposition 12 which provides a $2.1 billion bond issue with a significant proportion of the money being dedicated to protecting water quality, both by buying land around rivers and by reducing water pollution. In the last 10 years, states have improved their water monitoring programs and have significantly cut pollution, especially from factories and power plants. This is why most nitrate pollution now comes from farms and lawns.<p>Water quality has become an important political issue particularly in coastal states, partly because the number of pollution-related beach closings nationwide increased 50% between 1997 and 1999. Many states now have programs to both educate farmers and consumers about the problems of water pollution, and also to suggest simple ways to reduce the amount of nitrate that gets into water supplies.
