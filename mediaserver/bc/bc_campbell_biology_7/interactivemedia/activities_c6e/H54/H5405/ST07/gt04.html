People contribute to the problem of nitrate pollution mainly by using fertilizers incorrectly and through inadequate sewage treatment. Fifty years ago, most sewage treatment plants pumped raw sewage into rivers, and leaking septic tanks are still a major contributor to high nitrate levels in many areas. One innovative solution to both of these problems was worked out in 1926. The city of Milwaukee used a new process to treat its sewage: air was bubbled through the liquid sewage, and the water was removed to produce a solid that contained nitrogen. This solid was called Milorganite, for <b>Mil</b>waukee <b>Organ</b>ic N<b>it</b>rog<b>e</b>n, and sold as a fertilizer, particularly for lawns. One of the advantages of Milorganite is that it is a slow-release fertilizer, so even in heavy rains there is very little problem with nitrate washing into rivers. So human sewage has been turned into a useful fertilizer!
