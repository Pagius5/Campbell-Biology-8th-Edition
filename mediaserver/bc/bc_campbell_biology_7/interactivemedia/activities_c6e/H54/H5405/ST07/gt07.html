Correct. Nationwide, animals produce 130 times as much fecal waste as humans. In other words, farms produce 5 tons of animal manure a year for every man, woman, and child in the country. Some of this animal manure is stored in romantically named "manure lagoons."<br>Federal grants to farmers encourage them to cut down on the amount of nitrate that gets into rivers. For example, since 1983 the amount of nitrate washed into the Mississippi River has declined. Even simple ideas such as fencing off streams so that animal wastes cannot easily get into them can have a dramatic effect in reducing pollution.<p>Although 40% of rivers are still unsafe to swim in, this is an improvement on the 70% of rivers that were unsafe when the Clean Water Act was first implemented 25 years ago. Many individual rivers and bays are now much cleaner than in the past: examples include Long Island Sound, Tampa Bay, Galveston Bay, and San Francisco Bay.
