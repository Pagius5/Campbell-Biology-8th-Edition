Nitrate in human drinking water reduces the amount of oxygen being carried to the brain, and causes "blue baby syndrome" in infants less than 6 months old. The blood sample of an affected baby is a chocolate brown color instead of red. Nitrate poisoning can be treated, and in most cases the baby makes a full recovery. It is crucial, however, to deal with the problem immediately, because without treatment a baby can die.<p>Recent studies have shown a link between nitrate in drinking water and goiter. Goiter causes swelling in the neck, as shown in this photo.<p>There is also increased risk of developing insulin-dependent diabetes associated with moderate levels of nitrate in water supplies.<p>The recommended EPA limit for nitrates in drinking water is a maximum of 10 parts per million: in other words, 10 nitrate molecules mixed in a million water molecules. In 1995, 9% of drinking water wells tested had higher levels of nitrate than this.
