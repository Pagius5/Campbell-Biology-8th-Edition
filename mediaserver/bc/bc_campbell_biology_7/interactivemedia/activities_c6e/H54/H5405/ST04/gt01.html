Rivers with a lot of nitrate have algal blooms where algae grow so rapidly that when they die bacteria thrive and use up all the oxygen in the water. This low level of oxygen in the water is called hypoxia, and it kills fish and other organisms. Many states, such as North Carolina, keep records of "fish kills". These may involve tens of thousands of fish that are killed in a particular river, and are often caused by low oxygen levels. In addition, a particular <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('dinoflagellate.html');return false;">dinoflagellate</a>, called  <i>Pfiesteria</i>, sometimes increases in numbers in polluted water.  Unlike most dinoflagellates, which are photosynthetic, <i>Pfiesteria</i> actually kills fish and feeds on their skin.<p>This map shows the site of "fish kills" in North Carolina between January and September 2000.<p>During the summer months, a dead zone or hypoxia zone covering up to 7,000 square miles forms in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana. This is probably caused by nitrates washed down the Mississippi river.
