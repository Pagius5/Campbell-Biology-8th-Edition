Rivers are an important part of any ecosystem, providing water for people, plants and animals. Unfortunately, human activity often results in water pollution, which can affect all of these living things. In this activity, we will concentrate on one of the main pollutants: nitrate.<p>Animals need nitrogen because it is found in proteins and <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('dna.html');return false;">DNA</a>. Although the air around us contains a lot of nitrogen gas, we cannot use this gas directly. Instead, we get proteins and DNA from the food that we eat, and these chemicals are actually produced by plants. Plants take in nitrate from the soil, which is produced by bacteria from the nitrogen gas in the air.<p> Decomposers complete the cycle by changing proteins in dead organisms back to nitrate. So in a natural ecosystem nitrogen atoms are continually being recycled as nitrate or protein.
