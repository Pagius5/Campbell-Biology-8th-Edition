Livestock that are given drinking water with nitrates dissolved in it suffer from a variety of ailments. The symptoms of nitrate poisoning in animals include a bluish or brownish discoloring of the areas around the mouth and eyes. Animals may have a sluggish, staggering gait, rapid heartbeat, frequent urination, and labored breathing followed by collapse. In severe cases, convulsion and coma may occur, followed by death one to three hours after the first signs appear. Even moderate levels of nitrate in drinking water can cause livestock to grow more slowly than normal, and pregnant animals with nitrate poisoning have more stillbirths.
