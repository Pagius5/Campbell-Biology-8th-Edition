Carnivores, or <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('secondaryconsumers.html');return false;">secondary consumers</a>, eat meat. A carnivore that preys on duikers is the cheetah. Cheetahs are cats, but unlike lions and leopards they cannot retract their claws. They also cannot climb trees, so are always found on the ground. Cheetahs are the fastest land animals. Like most cats, cheetahs creep up close to their prey, and then dash the last few yards. Although they can reach speeds of 70 miles per hour they can only keep this up for about 20 seconds, so the prey often escapes. Click on the cheetah to see it run.
