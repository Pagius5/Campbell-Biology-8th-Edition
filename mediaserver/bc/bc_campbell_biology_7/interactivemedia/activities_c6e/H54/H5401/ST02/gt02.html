Notice how the cheetah's spine is so flexible that its rear legs hit the ground several feet <i>in front</i> of its front legs when it runs. Running obviously requires energy, and mammals typically use up about 95% of the energy from their food just in keeping warm, moving, and maintaining the chemical reactions in their body. For example, only 5% of the energy from an antelope, an herbivore, is passed on to the cheetah. This is similar to the "efficiency" of light bulbs-- roughly 95% of the energy a bulb uses is wasted as heat; only 5% is actually given off as light.
