Humans obviously control a large amount of the available land on earth, using it for farming, forestry, and cities.  There are estimates that humans use between 20% to 40% of the total amount of plant production worldwide, with the remainder used by all the other organisms on the planet. Some of the crops grown on farmland are eaten directly; others are fed to livestock to produce meat. Overall, over a third of the grain produced worldwide is fed to animals. In the last 50 years, meat production worldwide has grown dramatically, from 44 million tons in 1950 to 211 million tons in 1997.<br><br>At the moment, the worldwide population is just over 6 billion people, and this will probably grow to at least 11 billion by the year 2080. Some people worry that there will be mass starvation if the human population grows this much. From what you have learned about the pyramid of energy, what is one way to make sure that the planet can support more people?
