If people eat less meat, and more vegetables, this would increase the population that the planet could support.  There is much more energy in any ecosystem for primary consumers than secondary consumers. At the moment almost 70% of grain produced in the United States is fed to livestock. The problem of increasing meat consumption is not confined to this country. Meat production in China, for example, has risen from 8 million tons in 1975 to 45 million tons in 1996.<br><br>It should be noted, however, that since 1798 when Thomas Malthus published "Essay on the Principle of Population," people have raised the specter of widespread famine, but so far improvements in agriculture (especially in terms of crop yields) have kept up with the increasing human population.
