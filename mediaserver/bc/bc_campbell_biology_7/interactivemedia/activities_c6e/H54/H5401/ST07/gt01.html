The trophic level of humans is important, because the pyramid of energy shows that an ecosystem provides a lot more energy to primary consumers (herbivores) than it does to secondary consumers.  In other words, a large field of corn can supply food directly for many people, or it can be fed to cows to produce relatively little meat. In many parts of the world people eat relatively little meat, because the ecosystem cannot support large numbers of secondary or tertiary consumers. This is illustrated here.
