This is a savanna in East Africa, which is an ecosystem that has grasses and tall, flat-topped trees called acacias. Here, we will study how energy flows through the ecosystem. Energy enters as sunlight, which is used by plants in photosynthesis. Plants are called <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('producers.html');return false;">producers</a> because they produce the organic molecules that all living things need. Acacia trees are obviously producers, as are shrubs and grasses. Animals that feed on plants (herbivores) are <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('primaryconsumers.html');return false;">primary consumers</a>. An example of a primary consumer in Africa is the duiker. The name "duiker" means "diver," because when duikers are startled they run in a zigzag and then dive into the nearest undergrowth.  Duikers are medium-sized antelope, weighing about 50 pounds (20 kg). What do you think these herbivores feed on?
