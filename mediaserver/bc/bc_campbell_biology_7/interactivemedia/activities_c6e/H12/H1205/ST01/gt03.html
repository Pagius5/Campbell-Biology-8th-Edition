The amount of estrogen a woman produces over her lifetime influences her risk of breast cancer. When a woman ovulates, estrogen levels rise which cause cells in her breasts to divide. Every time a cell divides, there's a chance a mutation will occur that will lead to breast cancer. If estrogen levels remain high during a woman's life (for example, because of early menstruation or late menopause),  she has a higher risk of breast cancer. At least one other carcinogen is also linked to breast cancer.
