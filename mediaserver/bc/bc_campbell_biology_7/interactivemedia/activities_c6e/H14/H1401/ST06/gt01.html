<p>If we did not know the genotype of the F<sub>1</sub> individual, we could perform a testcross. Recall that in a testcross, an individual with the dominant phenotype is crossed with a homozygous recessive individual. In this example, half of the offspring have the dominant phenotype and half have the recessive phenotype, indicating that the parent with the dominant phenotype has the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('heterozygous.html');return false;">heterozygous</a> genotype.
