<p>A cross of an individual with a dominant phenotype to a homozygous recessive individual in order to find out its genotype is called a testcross. There are two possible outcomes of a testcross. As shown on the left, if all the F<sub>1</sub> offspring have the dominant phenotype then the genotype of the parent with the dominant phenotype is homozygous dominant, <I>OO</i> in this example. 
</p>
<p>As shown on the right, if half of the F<sub>1</sub>offspring have the dominant phenotype and half have the recessive phenotype, then the genotype of the parent with the dominant phenotype is <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('heterozygous.html');return false;">heterozygous</a>, <I>Oo</i> in this example.
