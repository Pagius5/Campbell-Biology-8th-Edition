Now we will cross a different set of parents that have the same phenotypes as the parents in the cross we just analyzed. Just because they have the same phenotypes doesn't mean they have the same genotypes, however. We must analyze the F<sub>1</sub> generation to help us understand the genetics. Using <i>O</i> for the black (wild type) allele and <i>o</i> for the orange allele, give the genotypes of the parents and the offspring. Explain your answer.
