How are the eye-color and skin-color traits inherited?<br><br>The total number of offspring in the F<sub>2</sub> generation is 527.  The F<sub>2</sub> phenotypic ratio is approximately 9 black eyes, green skin : 3 black eyes, white skin : 3 orange eyes, green skin : 1 orange eyes, white skin.<br><br>The simplest hypothesis is that there are two genes, and that this is a dihybrid cross with the two genes exhibiting independent assortment.  For one of the genes, orange eyes is recessive to black eyes.  For the other gene, white skin is recessive to green skin.
