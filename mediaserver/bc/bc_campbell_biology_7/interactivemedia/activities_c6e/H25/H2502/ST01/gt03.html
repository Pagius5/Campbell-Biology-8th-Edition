The beginning of the Paleozoic Era, 570 million years ago, marked the origin of most modern animal phyla. The first plants, jawless fish, bony fish, and amphibians evolved. Amphibians became the dominant vertebrate life form, while the first reptiles and seed plants appeared. By the end of the era, 245 million years ago, many marine and terrestrial organisms had become extinct.
