The Mesozoic Era stretched from 245 million to 65 million years ago. At the beginning of this era, the reptiles radiated out as dinosaurs to dominate the landscape, along with the cone-bearing plants, or gymnosperms.  At the same time, the first birds and mammals originated.  As the climate and Earth's surface changed, flowering plants appeared and many organisms, including most dinosaurs, became extinct.
