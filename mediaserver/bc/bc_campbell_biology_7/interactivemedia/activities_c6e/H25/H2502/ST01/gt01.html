By studying various fossil records, geologists have put together a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('geologictimescale.html');return false;">geological time scale</a> divided into a sequence of four historical intervals called eras, which are further divided into periods. Each era represents a distinct step in the evolutionary history of life. Evidence in the fossil record of large-scale extinctions and/or enormous radiation of many diverse new life forms defines the boundaries of these eras. Learn more about the evolutionary events of each era by grabbing the yellow arrow and moving the slide bar. As you move through the time scale, the information at the top of the screen will help you locate the geological eras and show you the history of continental drift.
