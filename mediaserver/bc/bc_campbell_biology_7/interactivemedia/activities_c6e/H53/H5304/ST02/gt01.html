Your first task is to investigate how island size affects the number of plant species present on an island.  The map to the left shows a number of different island groups located in the Pacific Ocean.<p>Click on an island group to collect information about the island area and the number of plant species present.  These data will automatically be added to the plot of number of species versus island size.<p>You will proceed to the next step once you have plotted data from all six island groups.
