You are correct!  As the area of an island increases, so does the number of different <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('habitats.html');return false;">habitats</a> found on that island.  A diversity of habitats supports greater <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('species.html');return false;">species</a> richness.  This relationship can be described by the following equation:<p>S = cA<sup>z</sup><p>where S represents the total number of species present, c is a constant measuring the number of species per unit of area, A is the total area of the island and z represents the rate at which species change as the area changes.  F.W. Preston first proposed this equation in 1962.<p>Now that you understand the relationship between island size and species richness, click on the "Next" button to investigate the effects of island distance.
