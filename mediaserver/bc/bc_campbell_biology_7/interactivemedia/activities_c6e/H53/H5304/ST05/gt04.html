The point where the curves for immigration rate and extinction rate intersect is the equilibrium number of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('species.html');return false;">species</a>.  Below this point colonization exceeds extinction and the number of species will continue to increase.  Above this point extinction exceeds colonization and the number of species will decline.<p>After a long time has passed since the emergence or disturbance of the island&mdash;hundreds to thousands of years&mdash;the number of species is predicted to be at this equilibrium number.<p>Click on the next button to see how colonization and extinction rates are influenced by island size and distance from the mainland.
