From altering island size and distance from the mainland, you should have noticed:<p>&#150; the highest expected species richness is predicted on large islands close to sources of potential colonists<p>&#150; the colonization rate is higher on near and small islands than on far and large islands<p>&#150; and species richness can be predicted if the shape of the immigration and extinction curves are known.<p>This figure encapsulates the ideas of the theory of island <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('biogeography.html');return false;">biogeography</a>.  MacArthur and Wilson formally developed this theory in 1967.  Not only does this theory explain patterns of species richness long noticed by naturalists, but it also allows for quantitative prediction of species richness.<p>The development of this theory allowed biogeographers to conduct more structured and more quantitative studies.  Ideas from the theory of island biogeography have also been used to design nature preserves and to examine species richness in other types of isolated or highly fragmented ecosystems.<p>
