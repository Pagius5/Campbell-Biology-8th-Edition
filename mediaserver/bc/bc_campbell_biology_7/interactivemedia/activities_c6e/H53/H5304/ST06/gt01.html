Change the position of this island (by dragging the island) and the size of this island (by dragging the red handle) to see how colonization and extinction rates are affected.<p>Islands closer to the mainland are more easily found; therefore, the colonization rates for these islands are higher.  Larger islands have more resources and a greater variety of habitats; therefore, their extinction rates are lower.<p>Notice that the equilibrium number of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('species.html');return false;">species</a> changes as you alter the island's size and distance. The predicted number of species at various sizes and distances should coincide with the observations you made in Steps 2, 3, and 4.  Go back and review these steps to see if this is true.<p>Click the "Next" button when you have finished exploring.
