Congratulations on completing your first task.<p>Your second task is to investigate how the distance from an island to the source of potential colonists (the mainland) affects the number of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('species.html');return false;">species</a> that inhabit that island.<p>The graphic to the left shows a number of similarly sized islands occurring at different distances from a mainland.<p>Click on an island to collect information about the island's distance and the number of plant species present.  These data will automatically be added to the plot of number of species versus distance.<p>You will proceed to the next step once you have plotted the data from all six islands.
