Islands are unique <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('ecosystems.html');return false;">ecosystems</a> that are often used by ecologists to investigate basic principles. Famous naturalists R. A. McArthur and E. O. Wilson first used islands to investigate factors that determined the number of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('species.html');return false;">species</a> present in a given area of land.  McArthur and Wilson assumed that most islands (particularly those formed by volcanic activity) were at one time empty ecological spaces with no species present.  They proposed that the number of species on an island represents a balance between the rate of species colonizing the island from the mainland and the rate of extinction of species already present on the island.  They developed a theory that established the subdiscipline of ecology known as island <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('biogeography.html');return false;">biogeography</a>.<p>In this activity, you will investigate how factors such as island size, distance from the mainland, and time determine the rates of species colonization and extinction.
