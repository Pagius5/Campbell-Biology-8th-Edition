4. Describe an <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('abioticfactor.html');return false;">abiotic factor</a> of marine <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('biomes.html');return false;">biomes</a> that is not significant in freshwater biomes.<br><br>Freshwater biomes lack the effects of a factor called salinity.  Salinity describes the salt content of water.  Marine environments generally have at least five times the salt content of fresh water.  Many marine organisms can only withstand a narrow range of salinity.  They will perish if the salt rises or lowers beyond this range.  An <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('estuary.html');return false;">estuary</a> is an area with highly variable salinity and has an array of organisms adapted to the changing salt concentrations.
