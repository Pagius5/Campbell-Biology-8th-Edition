2. Explain the nature of the abyssal zone of marine environments.<br><br>This zone is lacking in sunlight and water pressures are very high. Additionally, the temperatures in the abyssal zone are usually very cold.  The zone contains volcanoes, called vents.  It forms the deepest parts of the oceans and areas near the continental shelves.  The abyssal zone is host to many unusual fish, worms, starfish, and crabs specially adapted to the extreme conditions of that environment.
