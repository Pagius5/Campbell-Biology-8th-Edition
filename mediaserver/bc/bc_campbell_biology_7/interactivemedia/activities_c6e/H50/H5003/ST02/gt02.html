<b><a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('photiczone.html');return false;">Photic Zone</a></b><br><br>In fresh water, this zone lies along the shores and in the upper stratum of water in ponds, lakes, and rivers. Abundant sunlight and high oxygen content in the water characterize the photic zone. Plants, <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('algae.html');return false;">algae</a>, and <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('photosynthetic.html');return false;">photosynthetic</a> bacteria are very common in this zone, and produce the elevated levels of oxygen. <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('protists.html');return false;">Protists</a> and a large variety of small animals, including fish, inhabit this region. They feed on algae and other organisms. The water temperature in this zone is warmer than in other zones, but more variable. Some species of swimming birds are found in this zone. Along shorelines, the photic zone is also rich in animals that can live on land and in water.
