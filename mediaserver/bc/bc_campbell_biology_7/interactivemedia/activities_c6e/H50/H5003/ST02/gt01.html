Freshwater biomes, as well as marine biomes, are usually divided into smaller parts called life zones.  The types of organisms in a life zone are determined by the zone's <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('abiotic.html');return false;">abiotic</a> and <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('bioticfactors.html');return false;">biotic factors</a>.  Abiotic factors making up a zone include temperature, the amount of oxygen dissolved in the water, and the amount of sunlight penetrating the water.  The presence of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('algae.html');return false;">algae</a> or particular types of animals are important biotic factors that determine the distribution of other organisms in a freshwater life zone.<br><br>Click on the numbers on the diagram of the pond to collect a sample of organisms from the different freshwater biome life zones.  Note the differences in the types of organisms in each zone.
