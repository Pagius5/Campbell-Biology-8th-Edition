<b>Aphotic Zone</b><br><br>Little light penetrates into this zone of open water, and it is low in oxygen.  The dim light conditions reduce <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('photosynthesis.html');return false;">photosynthesis</a> resulting in the lower oxygen content.  Water temperatures in this zone are generally stable, but much cooler than the water above it.  This zone contains large fish that feed on smaller fish and dead matter.
