<b><a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('aphoticzone.html');return false;">Aphotic Zone</a></b><br><br>This deeper region of ocean is usually colder than surface waters and contains few algae. Large predatory fish are more common than smaller fish here, but are not as numerous as smaller species higher up in the water.  A variety of other animals live along the continental shelf regions of this zone including crabs, corals, starfish, octopuses, and clams.<br><br>The aphotic zone includes the abyssal zone. This zone is very cold and always dark. Water pressures are enormous. Underwater volcanoes, called vents, are found in this region.  Few organisms live in the abyssal zone.  It is, however, home to exotic fish that feed on the other fish and the bodies of dead organisms from the upper regions.
