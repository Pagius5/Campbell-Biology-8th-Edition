The marine <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('biome.html');return false;">biome</a> comprises the largest of the biomes on the Earth.  In spite of the vastness of oceans and seas, most of the organisms are abundant in only a small part of their huge volume. As with freshwater biomes, the life zones of marine biomes are determined initially by <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('abioticfactors.html');return false;">abiotic factors</a> and are further modified by <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('bioticfactors.html');return false;">biotic factors</a>.  Marine biomes differ in having a variable abiotic factor called salinity.  Salinity is the salt content of marine water. In <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('estuaries.html');return false;">estuaries</a>, fresh water mixes with salt water, and salinities are lower. Very high salinity waters can be found in deep ocean water and shallow areas near warm beaches.  Some bodies of water, such as the Great Salt Lake in Utah and the Dead Sea in Israel, have very high salinities.<br><br>Click on the numbers on the diagram to collect a sample of organisms from the different marine biome life zones.  Note the differences in the types of organisms in each zone.
