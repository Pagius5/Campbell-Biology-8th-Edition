Kangaroo rats rely on anatomical, behavioral, and physiological <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('adaptations.html');return false;">adaptations</a> to exploit the desert nights. Anatomical adaptations of the eyes and ears permit them to hunt at night to reduce water loss. Their behaviors encourage nighttime foraging to reduce exposure to the hot and dehydrating days. Physiological adaptations include an ability to extract metabolic water from foods.
