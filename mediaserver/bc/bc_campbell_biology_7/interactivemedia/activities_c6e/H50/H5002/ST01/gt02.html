A cactus uses primarily anatomical <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('adaptations.html');return false;">adaptations</a> to survive in the desert during the day.  Its lack of leaves preserves water, and a thick photosynthetic stem captures sunlight and stores water. A deep and extensive tap root system permits the cactus to collect the scarce desert water. Thorns inhibit large desert animals from feeding on the water-rich tissues.
