This bird has anatomical <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('adaptations.html');return false;">adaptations</a> that make it suitable for eating a narrow range of foods. By limiting the types of food it eats, the bird is less likely to compete for resources with other birds exploiting the summer environment. Behavioral adaptations encourage the bird to seek a territory for raising its offspring and to produce a song for selecting an appropriate mate.
