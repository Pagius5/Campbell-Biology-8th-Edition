Squirrels use anatomical and physiological <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('adaptations.html');return false;">adaptations</a> to survive the winter. They have accumulated much body fat in the summer and use the fat to get through the scarcity of food during the winter. Behavioral adaptations cause them to be inactive and seek shelter. Inactivity conserves the body fat needed to protect them from the cold and provide energy when little food is available. Likewise, the behavioral adaptation to overeat and hoard food during the summer helps them survive the winter. They come out to feed on stored and exotic foods in the winter only when it is necessary.
