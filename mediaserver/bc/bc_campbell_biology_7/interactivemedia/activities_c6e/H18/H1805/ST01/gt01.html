This activity will help you understand how gene expression is regulated in bacteria, causing genes to be turned on and off in response to environmental signals. You will find information on how genes in bacteria are grouped together in functional groups called operons, the function of various segments of DNA in operons, and how specific molecules start and stop transcription within operons.<br><br>Bacteria adapt to changes in their surroundings by using regulatory proteins to turn groups of genes on and off in response to various environmental signals.<br><br>The DNA of <i>Escherichia coli</i> is sufficient to encode about 4,000 proteins, but only a fraction of these are made at any one time. <i>E. coli</i> regulates the expression of many of its genes according to the food sources that are available to it.
