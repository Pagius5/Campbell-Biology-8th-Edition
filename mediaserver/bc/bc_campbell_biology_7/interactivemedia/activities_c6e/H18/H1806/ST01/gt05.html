Operators are regions of DNA that interact with regulatory proteins that control the transcription operons.<br><br>Here's an analogy. A promoter is like a door knob, in that the promoters of many operons are similar. An operator is like the key hole in a door knob, in that each door is locked by only a specific key, which in this analogy is a specific regulatory protein.
