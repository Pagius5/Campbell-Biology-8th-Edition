Plant cells are surrounded by rigid <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cellwalls.html');return false;">cell walls</a>. When plant cells are exposed to <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('hypotonic.html');return false;">hypotonic</a> environments, water rushes into the cell, and the cell swells, but is kept from breaking by the rigid wall layer. The pressure of the cell pushing against the wall makes the cell turgid, and is the desired state for most plant tissues. For instance, placing a wilted celery stalk or lettuce leaf in a hypotonic environment of pure water will often revive the leaf by inducing turgor in the plant cells.
