In <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('pinocytosis.html');return false;">pinocytosis</a>, or "cell drinking," the cell engulfs extracellular fluid, including molecules such as sugars and proteins. These materials enter the cell inside a vesicle. Epithelial cells in capillaries use pinocytosis to engulf the liquid portion of blood at the capillary surface. The resulting vesicles travel across the capillary cells and release their contents to surrounding tissues, while blood cells remain in the blood.<br><br>
