These transport situations illustrate the use of active transport to move glucose from the gut across an intestinal cell membrane. For each of the situations shown, choose the figure which best represents the outcome after movement of the glucose by an appropriate active transport carrier.<br><br>2. If the initial concentrations are as shown in Figure B, the outcome of active transport will be as shown in Figure...<br><br>Correct! The answer is A. This active transport system will maintain a higher concentration of glucose inside the cell because it can only move glucose into the cell.
