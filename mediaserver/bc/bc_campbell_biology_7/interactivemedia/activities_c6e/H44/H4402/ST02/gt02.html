Blood cells and <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('plasma.html');return false;">plasma</a> proteins stay in the blood-- they are just too big-- but all the other substances are filtered from the blood and form the filtrate that accumulates in the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('nephron.html');return false;">nephron</a> tubule.<br><br>As the filtrate moves along the proximal tubule, certain substances are transported from the blood and added to the filtrate, a process called secretion. Secretion of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('hydrogenions.html');return false;">hydrogen ions</a> helps to regulate body <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('ph.html');return false;">pH</a>. Certain poisons are also secreted to remove them from the blood.<br><br>This list summarizes substances contained in the filtrate. Filtration is not selective, so some of these substances are useful to the body, and it is important that they be returned to the blood. Click on the substances that the body generally needs to recover from the filtrate.
