One problem with introduced species, such as fire ants, is that they have no natural enemies, so they often become extremely prolific. <p>Two ways of controlling fire ants are:<p>(a) Using baits that are carried back to the nest by the workers, and fed to the queen. When the queen is killed, the colony slowly dies out. This may take several weeks.<p>(b) Chemical treatment with powders or liquid drenches kill most of the colony instantly.<p>These methods can keep fire ant numbers down, but they are expensive. Texas alone spends $600 million a year to control fire ants, and California plans to spend $650 million in 6 months to quarantine and control these pests.
