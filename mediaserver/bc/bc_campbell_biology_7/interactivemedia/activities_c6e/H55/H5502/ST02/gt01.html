Fire ants can spread naturally up to 10 miles per year when winged adults fly away and start a new colony. An established colony can produce up to 5,000 new queens a year, each of which can start a new colony.<p>Colonies can also be spread accidentally by humans, either in ships (for example, in soil used as ballast), or in trucks and trains that transport soil or plants.<p>From 1930 to 1939 fire ants spread about 60 miles from their original site in Mobile, Alabama. How do you think they spread this distance?
