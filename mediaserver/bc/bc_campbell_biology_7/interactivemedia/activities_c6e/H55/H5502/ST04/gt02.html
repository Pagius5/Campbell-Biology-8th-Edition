There are several possible reasons that fire ant quarantines have not worked well.  Some of these are:<p>(a) Many people do not know that there is a quarantine, and they transport  plants (and fire ant colonies) when they move to a new house.<p>(b) A single mated queen can start a new colony, and can be carried from state to state in vehicles without being noticed.<p>(c) Colonies are underground, and often overlooked, so states that were listed as "uninfected" may already have had colonies of fire ants.
