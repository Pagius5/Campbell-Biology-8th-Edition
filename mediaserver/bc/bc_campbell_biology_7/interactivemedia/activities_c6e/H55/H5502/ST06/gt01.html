One new technique that is being investigated is to introduce natural enemies of the fire ants.<p>Two new species have been introduced in the U.S. to try to control fire ants. The first is a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('protist.html');return false;">protist</a> called <i>Thelohania solenopsae</i>. This infects the queen and the eggs that she lays, and gradually kills the colony. This species was introduced in 1998.<p>The second species is a phorid fly called <i>Pseudacteon tricuspus</i>. These flies inject their eggs into the fire ants. The egg hatches into a larva that eats its way into the ant's head.  Eventually, the ant's head falls off, so these flies are often called "ant-decapitating flies".  Not surprisingly, this kills the ant, and the larva emerges from the ant's head. This fly was first released in the U.S. in 1997.<p>Do you think that this idea of releasing more introduced species to control fire ants is a good idea? What potential problems could these new species cause?
