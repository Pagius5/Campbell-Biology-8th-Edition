Fire ants <i> (Solenopsis invicta)</i>  are native to South America, and were accidentally introduced into the U.S. in the 1930s, probably in soil from a ship that docked in Mobile, Alabama. They are aggressive, inflicting painful bites on humans. In rare cases, people who are allergic to the bites can go into anaphylactic shock and die. So far fire ants have caused about 20 deaths in the U.S.<p>Fire ants live in colonies. Each colony has a fertile female (the queen) who lays eggs, and many sterile females (the workers) who collect food, build the nest, and raise the young. Each colony may have between 50,000 and 500,000 worker ants. Usually the colonies are under ground, but small mounds may be visible on the surface of the soil. Colonies may also move into houses and other structures, where they can cause electrical short circuits.
