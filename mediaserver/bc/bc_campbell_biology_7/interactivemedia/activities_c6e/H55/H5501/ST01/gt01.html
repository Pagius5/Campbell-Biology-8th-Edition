Some areas of the earth are relatively small in terms of land area, but have an exceptional concentration of species. These biological treasures are called <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('biodiversity.html');return false;">biodiversity</a> hot spots. Conservation International identifies these hot spots using three criteria: the number of species present, the number of species that are <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('endemic.html');return false;">endemic</a> (found nowhere else) and the degree to which the species are threatened with extinction. One of these hot spots is Madagascar. Madagascar is the fourth largest island in the world. It is roughly 1,000 miles long and 350 miles wide, and sits in the Indian Ocean 250 miles off the east coast of Africa. Geologists estimate that it split off from the African continent about 160 million years ago.<p>Madagascar has a fascinating mixture of plants and animals, most of them very different from the species in nearby Africa. For example, Madagascar has no large mammals like elephants, rhinos, leopards, or lions. In fact, there are only 8 species of carnivores on the island, and the largest is about the size of a domestic cat.<br>Although Madagascar is only 2% of the land area of Africa, it is home to a quarter of all African plants. In the next section we will look at plants in more detail.
