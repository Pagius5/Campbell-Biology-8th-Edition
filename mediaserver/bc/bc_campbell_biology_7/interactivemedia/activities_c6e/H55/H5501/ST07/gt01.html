In the last ten years, the government of Madagascar, with the help of groups such as Conservation International, World Wildlife Fund, and the Missouri Botanical Garden, has started to protect unspoiled areas as national parks. The Ranomafana National Park was set up in 1991.<p>Over half a million acres were protected in 1997 as Masoala National Park. These national parks will not only protect wildlife, but will provide a way for local people to earn a living without destroying the natural forest. In August 2000, the World Bank set up a $150 million fund to protect ecological hot spots. Madagascar is one of only three areas worldwide targeted by this fund in its first year.<br>Masoala, the newest national park in Madagascar, is a gorgeous pristine area that contains abundant wildlife, including lemurs, reptiles, and birds.
