Correct. Lemurs are primates (a group which also includes monkeys, apes, and humans) that are related to bushbabies. Fossils show that lemurs evolved before monkeys and apes, and were once widespread in Europe, Africa, and America. Now they are confined to Madagascar. Unlike most primates, lemurs rely more on smell than sight to find their food. They also have a unique "voice", which you can hear by clicking on the photo.
