Although Madagascar is close to Africa, the first humans probably arrived from Indonesia, about 2,000 years ago. The traditional farming method was to cut down a small area of forest, burn the trees to fertilize the soil, and then plant rice. After a couple of seasons the farmers moved on, abandoning the land, which slowly reverted to forest. Many years later the farmers would return and repeat this process.<p>As the population increased, land was burned more frequently, so the forest could no longer recover. Eventually this led to dry, infertile soil that eroded easily and could not support crops or forest. This photo of Madagascar, taken from the space shuttle, shows smoke near the top of the photo from burning fields. The red color in the sea is soil that has washed down into the ocean.
