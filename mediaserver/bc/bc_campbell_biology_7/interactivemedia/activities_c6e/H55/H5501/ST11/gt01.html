Madagascar is an interesting place, but it is rather remote. Why does it matter if forests are cut down, or biodiversity is reduced?<p>There are many answers to this question. Here are a few:<p>Many medications are produced from plants, such as the rosy periwinkle, which is a source of anticancer drugs, and is only found in Madagascar. Pharmaceutical companies have begun looking at other plants to find out if they could be medically important. Madagascar has many unique species of <i>Impatiens</i>, one of the most common and popular garden plants. Animals such as lemurs are fascinating and irreplaceable. If they become extinct we can never bring them back. If deforestation continues in Madagascar, it will cause a crisis in the human population there.<p>As John Donne wrote, almost 400 years ago:<p>No man is an island, entire of itself; &hellip;<br>any man's death diminishes me,<br>for I am involved in mankind,<br>and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;<br>It tolls for thee.<p>John Donne (1572-1631)<p>Perhaps we should extend this idea to all species, not just humans!
