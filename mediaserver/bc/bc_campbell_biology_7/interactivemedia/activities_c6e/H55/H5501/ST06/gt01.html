The human population of Madagascar is growing rapidly. The average woman has more than 5 children. The population doubles about every 25 years. The graph shows the population growth from 1950 to 2000. Move the line for the year 2050 to where you think it should be, then click on "Done" to show the real estimate.<p>This rapidly growing population puts great pressure on natural ecosystems.
