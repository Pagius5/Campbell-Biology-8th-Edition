Bird watchers are fascinated by Madagascar, which has roughly 200 different species of birds, half of them endemic. This photo of a <i>Coua</i>, which is a type of cuckoo, is an example  of a  bird found nowhere else on earth. Including the coua, Madagascar has 3 of the most endangered bird species in the world, including the red owl and serpent-eagle.<p>Biologists from the Idaho-based Peregrine Fund rediscovered the serpent-eagle in 1993. It had been more than 60 years since scientists had seen this bird, and it was feared extinct. Almost nothing is known about its habits, and it had never before been photographed. The scientists were able to radio-collar a bird so that they could follow its movements.<p>Also in 1993, the red owl was found for the first time since 1934. Both of these species are found in the new Masoala National Park, and the Peregrine Fund is training local Malagasy people to protect and conserve these unique birds.
