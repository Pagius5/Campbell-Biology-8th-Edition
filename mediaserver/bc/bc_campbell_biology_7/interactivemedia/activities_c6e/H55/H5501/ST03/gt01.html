Madagascar is rich in orchids, like this <i>Cymbidiella</i> which is unique to the island. There are over 1,000 species of orchid native to Madagascar, and more species are discovered regularly. Most of the orchids grow in rainforest. Since humans arrived in Madagascar roughly 2,000 years ago, much of the original forest has been chopped down, as the next page will illustrate.
