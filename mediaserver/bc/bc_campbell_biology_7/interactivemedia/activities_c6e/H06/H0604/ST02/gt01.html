How does a living cell overcome the energy barrier so that its metabolic reactions can occur quickly and precisely? A special kind of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('protein.html');return false;">protein</a> called an <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('enzyme.html');return false;">enzyme</a> is the answer. An enzyme serves as a biological catalyst, increasing the rate of a reaction without being changed into a different molecule. An enzyme does not add energy to a reaction; instead, it speeds up a reaction by lowering the energy barrier.
