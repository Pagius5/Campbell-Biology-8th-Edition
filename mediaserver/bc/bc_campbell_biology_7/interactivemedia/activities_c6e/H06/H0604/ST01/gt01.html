If <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('exergonicreactions.html');return false;">exergonic reactions</a> occur spontaneously, what keeps <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('molecules.html');return false;">molecules</a> from breaking apart and cell chemistry from racing out of control? For any reaction to occur, even a downhill reaction, some energy must be added to get the reaction going. This energy is needed to break bonds in the reactant molecules. The energy needed to start a chemical reaction is called the energy of activation (E<sub>A</sub>). This required energy input represents a barrier that prevents even energy-releasing exergonic reactions from occurring without some added energy.
