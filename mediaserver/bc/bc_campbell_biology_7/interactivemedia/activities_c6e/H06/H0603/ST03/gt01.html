Chemical reactions that release <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('energy.html');return false;">energy</a> are called <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('exergonicreactions.html');return false;">exergonic reactions</a>. You might call exergonic reactions "downhill" reactions. Other reactions, called <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('endergonicreactions.html');return false;">endergonic reactions</a>, are "uphill" changes; they absorb energy from their surroundings.
