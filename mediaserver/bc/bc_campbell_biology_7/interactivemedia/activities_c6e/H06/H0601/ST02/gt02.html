As the arrow flies through the air, <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('heat.html');return false;">heat</a> is generated by friction between the arrow and air molecules. When the arrow strikes the target, all the energy becomes heat energy. The heat energy is rapidly transferred into the air and spreads out. Heat energy is a very disordered kind of energy. It has the highest amount of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('entropy.html');return false;">entropy</a>, or disorder, of any kind of energy.
