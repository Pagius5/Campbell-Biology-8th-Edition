<a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('glycolysis.html');return false;">Glycolysis</a> is a series of steps in which a glucose molecule is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. As the chemical bonds in glucose are broken, electrons (and hydrogen ions) are picked up by NAD<sup>+</sup>, forming NADH. Glucose is oxidized and NAD<sup>+</sup> is reduced. A net output of two <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('atp.html');return false;">ATP</a> molecules are also produced in glycolysis for every glucose molecule processed. But most of the energy released by the breakdown of glucose is carried by the electrons attached to NADH.
