The <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('electrontransportchain.html');return false;">electron transport chain</a> has used the energy of moving electrons to pump hydrogen ions into the intermembrane space. This buildup of hydrogen ions-- like water behind a dam-- stores the potential energy that was originally in the bonds of glucose molecules. <br><br>The backed-up hydrogen ions give up their energy when they diffuse through a special protein in the membrane called <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('atp.html');return false;">ATP</a> synthase. As hydrogen ions flow down their concentration gradient, ATP synthase captures their energy to make ATP. This mode of ATP production is called <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('oxidativephosphorylation.html');return false;">oxidative phosphorylation</a> because it is powered by the transfer of electrons to oxygen.
