<a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('connectivetissue.html');return false;">Connective tissue</a> forms the framework of the body, binding and supporting other tissues. Connective tissue cells are often widely scattered, embedded in an extracellular <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('matrix.html');return false;">matrix</a>.
