<p>The system of measure used in the United States -- based on inches, feet, miles, and so on -- is not convenient for scientific use. Devised in France in 1791, the metric system is much simpler and is used for all scientific measurements, from the distance between galaxies to the size of an atom.<br><br>The metric system was expanded in 1960 into the International System of Units. (Metric units are sometimes called SI units for "Systeme Internationale"). The major features of both systems are: </p>
<ul>
<li>The use of decimals.
<li>The use of prefixes.
<li>Standards defined in terms of basic, unchanging physical properties.
</ul>
<p> The metric system is used to measure a variety of things. Refer to the chart at the left for an overview of some common categories and units of measure.</p>
