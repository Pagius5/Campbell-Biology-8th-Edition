One problem in defining prefixes like "micro-" as 1/1,000,000 is keeping track of all those zeroes. It is much simpler to use exponential notation (also called "powers of ten" notation). For example, we can represent 1,000,000 as 10<SUP>6</SUP>.  This tells us to multiply 10 by itself 6 times: (10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10).<br><br>Examine the following series: <br>10 = 10, or 10<SUP>1</SUP><BR><BR><r><t>100 = 10 x 10, or 10<SUP>2</SUP><BR><BR><r><t>1000  = 10 x 10 x 10, or 10<SUP>3</SUP><BR><BR><r><t>10,000  = 10 x 10 x 10 x 10, or 10<SUP>4</SUP><r></p><r><p>The superscript numbers 1, 2, 3, and so on are called exponents. Notice that increasing by one exponent is the same as multiplying by 10. For instance, if you have 10<SUP>2</SUP> dollars and you increase your fortune to 10<SUP>3</SUP> dollars, you have gone from $100 to $1000. So one exponent change is a sizable change.</P><P> Any number can be represented as an integer times 10 raised to an exponent. <br>30 can be represented as 3 x 10<SUP>1</SUP> <BR><BR><r><t>30,000 can be represented as 3 x 10<SUP>4</SUP><BR><BR><r><t>0.003 can be represented as 3 x 10<SUP>-3</SUP><r></p>
