The metric system makes it easier to measure very large or very small objects.  You can use small integral numbers such as 1, 3.5, or 12, rather than numbers with lots of zeroes (40,000,000 or 0.000003).<br><br>For example, most cells range from 10<SUP>-6</SUP> to 10<SUP>-4</SUP> meters.  Microscopists use the micrometer (&micro;m, also called the micron) as their standard unit of length, and talk about a bacterium  being 1.5 &micro;m long and  a lymphocyte 10 &micro;m in diameter.  The micrograph to the left shows a bacterial cell a little over 1 &micro;m in length.    Since the diameter of the smallest atom (hydrogen) is just 10<SUP>-10</SUP> m, many chemists use the nanometer (nm) to record molecular and atomic sizes.  One hydrogen atom is 0.1 nm in diameter.<br><br> One curious exception to "standard" metric notation is the Angstrom (&Aring;), named after Swedish physicist Anders Jonas Angstrom (1814-1874).  One Angstrom is defined as 10<SUP>-10</SUP> m, so the diameter of one hydrogen atom is just 1 &Aring;.
