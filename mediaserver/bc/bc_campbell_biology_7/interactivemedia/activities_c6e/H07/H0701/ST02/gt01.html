For each category of measurement, the base unit can be multiplied by a power of ten to form smaller or larger units.  The name of each unit is made by adding a prefix to the base unit.  The most commonly used prefixes are centi- (for 1/100), milli- (for 1/1000) and kilo- (for 1000).  In measuring length, for example, a kilometer is 1000 meters.  In measuring liquid volume, a milliliter is 1/1000 of a liter.
