In <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('gapjunction.html');return false;">gap junctions</a>, or communicating junctions, two cells are separated by a small gap, which is bridged by specialized channels that allow the passage of water and small molecules. Gap junctions help coordinate the activities of adjacent cells. For example, a hormone that stimulates one cell will often activate adjacent cells as well by the passage of intracellular signals through gap junctions.
