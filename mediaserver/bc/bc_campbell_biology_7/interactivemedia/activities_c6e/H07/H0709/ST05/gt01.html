Plant cells, unlike animal cells, are surrounded by thick walls that form rigid tissues. They do not need the junctions found in animal tissues.  But some higher plant cells are interconnected by <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('plasmodesmata.html');return false;">plasmodesmata</a>, tubelike structures that penetrate through cell walls and form fluid connections between adjacent cells. Like <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('gapjunction.html');return false;">gap junctions</a> in animal cells, plamodesmata allow the free exchange of small molecules and help coordinate the activities of neighboring cells.
