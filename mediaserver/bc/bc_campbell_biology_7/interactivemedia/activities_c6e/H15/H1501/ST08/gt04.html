First, we must realize that we are asked to find map distance because the genes are linked. We can see that the genes are linked because of the excess of parental phenotypes in the offspring of the testcross (72 + 69 = 141 parentals versus 11 + 6 = 17 nonparentals). If the genes assorted independently, there would have been a 1:1:1:1 ratio of the four phenotypic classes. Map distance is calculated from the formula for recombination frequency shown at the bottom of the screen:<br><br>number of recombinants/<br>total offspring x 100<br>= 17/158 x 100<br>= 10.8 per cent recombination frequency<br>= 10.8 map units between the genes for eye color (o) and striping (z).
