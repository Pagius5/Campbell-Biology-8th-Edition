For linked genes, we need to include the chromosome in our genotype diagrams, as shown here. We will use the symbol v for the vertical-eyes allele and V for the round-eyes allele, and t for the tooth allele and T for the no-tooth allele. We can conclude that the F<sub>1</sub> MendAliens have the round-eyes and no-tooth phenotypes because the vertical-eyes and tooth alleles are recessive.
