Recombination frequency data are used to assign gene positions on a chromosome map. One map unit is the equivalent of a 1% recombination frequency. Thus, the v and t genes are 14.3 map units apart.<br><br>In summary, when genes are linked, they do not assort independently. That is, from a testcross involving an individual heterozygous for each of two genes, the offspring will not exhibit a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio expected for independently assorting genes. Instead, there will be an excess of the parental phenotypes. Results of such testcrosses can be used to calculate the map distance between the two genes involved.
