Here are the results of the testcross between the F<sub>1</sub> individual and a homozygous recessive individual-- an alien with vertical eyes and a tooth. If the two genes showed independent assortment, we would expect a 1:1:1:1 ratio of phenotypes from the testcross. Instead, most offspring resemble the phenotypes of the two original parents (the parent with normal round eyes and no tooth, and the parent with vertical eyes and a tooth). We must conclude that the genes do not assort independently; that is, the eye-shape and tooth phenotypes are usually inherited together because the genes for these two characteristics are near each other on the same chromosome. In other words, the genes are linked.
