Correct. This <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('zygote.html');return false;">zygote</a> would have a total of 12 chromosomes. Extra sets of chromosomes is termed <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('polyploidy.html');return false;">polyploidy</a>. This particular zygote is tetraploid, because it has 4 sets of chromosomes, instead of the usual 2 sets. The zygote could develop into a tetraploid plant. In plants, such polyploids are often viable and even vigorous. In this individual, all 4 sets of chromosomes were derived from a single parent species.
