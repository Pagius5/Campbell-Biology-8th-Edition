Let's add genotypes to the crosses. We will use s for the short-legs allele and S for the normal-legs allele. There is a recessive s allele on each of the parental female's X chromosomes, while the parental male has the normal S allele on his X chromosome and no allele on the Y chromosome. The F<sub>1</sub> female has the normal phenotype because she inherited the recessive allele on the X chromosome from her mother, but she inherited the normal allele on the X chromosome from her father. The F<sub>1</sub> male has the recessive phenotype because he inherited the recessive allele on the X chromosome from his mother, and there is no allele on the Y chromosome that he inherited from his father. A trait is inherited as an X-linked recessive if a cross between a female with the recessive trait, and a true-breeding normal male results in all male offspring having the recessive trait and all female offspring having the normal phenotype.
