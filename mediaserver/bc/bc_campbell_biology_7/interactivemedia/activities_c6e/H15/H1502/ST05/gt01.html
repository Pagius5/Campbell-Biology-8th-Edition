The F<sub>1</sub> cross shows that short legs is not caused by a simple recessive allele. Looking at the F<sub>2</sub> offspring of this cross, we see that there is a 3:1 ratio of normal to short offspring. But when we look at males and females separately, we see that this ratio is not the same for the two sexes. This indicates that the leg-length gene is linked to the X chromosome, with the short-legs allele recessive to the normal-legs allele. Had we not looked at the sexes separately, we might not have seen that sex linkage was involved. <p>Notice that for traits caused by an X-linked recessive allele, the F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> results are different for the cross between a female with the recessive trait and a normal male, and the cross between a normal female and a male with the recessive trait. Thus, a reciprocal cross must always be made when the gene could be X-linked.
