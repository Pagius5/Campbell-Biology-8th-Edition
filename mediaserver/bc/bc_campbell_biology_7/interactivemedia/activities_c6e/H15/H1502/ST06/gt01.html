Here's a genetics problem for you to work out. The pointed-ear trait in MendAliens is caused by an X-linked recessive allele. We will use e for the pointed-ears (recessive) allele and E for the normal no-ear allele. <p>A female MendAlien, Marge, with no ears (the normal condition), and whose male parent had pointed ears, pairs with a male MendAlien with no ears whose male parent had pointed ears. Select the correct genotypes for the parents. Then select the correct genotypes for the offspring. Finally, select the correct proportions of the phenotypes in the offspring.
