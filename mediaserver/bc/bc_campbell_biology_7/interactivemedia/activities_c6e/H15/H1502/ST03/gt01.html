Now let's add genotypes to the F<sub>1</sub> cross. Assuming that our F<sub>1</sub> individuals have the genotypes worked out in the previous step, we would predict that the F<sub>2</sub> generation would have a ratio of 1 normal female : 1 short female : 1 normal male : 1 short male. These expected ratios are approximately matched by our observed F<sub>2</sub> results of 38 normal females : 33 short females : 41 normal males : 35 short males. <p>In conclusion, leg length can be explained by a single gene on the X chromosome with the short-legs allele recessive to the normal-legs allele. This cross illustrates the inheritance of an X-linked recessive allele.
