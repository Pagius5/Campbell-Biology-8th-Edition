Cell-to-cell signaling, with molecules carrying signals from sending cells to receiving (target) cells, is a key mechanism in the coordination of cellular activities. In most cases, a signal molecule acts by binding to a receptor protein in the plasma membrane of the target cell and activating a series of changes-- a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('signaltransductionpathway.html');return false;">signal-transduction pathway</a>--  that triggers a specific response within the cell. Click on the signal molecule to activate this signal-transduction pathway.
