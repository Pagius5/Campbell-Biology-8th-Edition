Read the text and then click on the triangle to play the video. (The video is visual only, without narration.)<br><br><I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>, or <I>C. elegans</I>, is a species of nematode (roundworm) that normally lives in the soil and eats bacteria. The worm shown here is crawling on an agar plate in a lab, demonstrating movements similar to those it would normally use to move through the soil. Structures and organs in this worm are clearly visible. Since an adult of this species is made up of only about 1000 cells, and these worms are easy to raise in a lab, <I>C. elegans</I> has become a popular species for the study of embryonic development. The adult shown here, like most adult <I>C. elegans</I>, is a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite: each adult produces both sperm and eggs, and fertilization is internal. Adult hermaphrodites are 1 millimeter long.
