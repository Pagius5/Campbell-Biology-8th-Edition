Read the text and then click on the triangle to play the video. (The video is visual only, without narration.)<br><br><I>C. elegans</I>, the soil worm or nematode, is a useful species for the study of embryonic development because the lineage and fates of all cells are known, and also genetic techniques can be used to determine the function of specific genes. This time-lapse video shows the first 15 hours of development from a fertilized egg to a fully formed worm. The elapsed real time is displayed at the upper left. The fertilized egg is about 50 microns long (1/20th of a millimeter), and contains two nuclei. The nucleus on the right is from the egg; the one on the left was contributed by the sperm at fertilization.<br><br>This one cell will divide into all the cell types of the embryo, including muscle cells, nerve cells, and gut cells. The fates of some cells are determined quite early. For example, at 00:56:01 (hours:minutes:seconds of real time) there are eight cells. The cell on the lower left with the clearly visible nucleus in this frame is the cell that will make all the cells of the entire gut of the adult worm. Other cells will give rise to muscle cells, nerve cells, and so on.<br><br>The mass of cells elongates into a worm shape (which begins around 5:32:01 in this video), and during this period some of the cells that have formed are becoming functional muscle cells, so the embryo starts to twitch and then crawl around inside the eggshell (starting around 7:24:01 in this video).<br><br>In the final frame, the head is near the top, and the tail is near the bottom.
