Only one <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('myosin.html');return false;">myosin</a> head is shown here, but a typical <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('thickfilament.html');return false;">thick filament</a> has hundreds of heads, pulling against several surrounding thin filaments at once. Each myosin head is able to bind and unbind about five times per second. The heads do not work in synchrony. Some are bound to thin filaments while others are reaching for new binding sites. Smooth contraction of a muscle results from the simultaneous, combined pulling and sliding of millions of thick and thin filaments in thousands of muscle fibers.
