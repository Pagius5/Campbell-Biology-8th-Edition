The lens focuses light on the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('retina.html');return false;">retina</a> by bending light rays, and it changes shape to adjust focus when you look at near or distant objects.<br><br>When you look at a nearby object, muscles attached to the choroid contract, allowing <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('ligament.html');return false;">ligaments</a> attached to the lens to slacken. This reduces tension on the elastic lens, which becomes thicker and rounder, bending light rays more sharply into focus. This is called <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('accommodation.html');return false;">accommodation</a>.<br><br>When you look at a more distant object, the muscles attached to the choroid relax. This allows the ligaments to pull on the edges of the lens, flattening it. The flatter lens bends light less sharply, focusing light from the more distant object onto the retina.<br><br>Click on the buttons to compare near and distance vision.
