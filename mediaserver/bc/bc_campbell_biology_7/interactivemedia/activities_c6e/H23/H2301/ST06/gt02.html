The birds could see the red insects more easily against the background, so they caught a disproportionate number of the red bugs. This reduced the frequency of the red <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('alleles.html');return false;">alleles</a> in the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('genepool.html');return false;">gene pool</a>, increased the frequency of green alleles, and similarly altered the relative numbers of green and red individuals in the population. Over time, this process of natural selection adapts a population to its environment. Under pressure of predation, the insects are becoming more and more green.
