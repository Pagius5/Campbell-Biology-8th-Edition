Each pair of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('homologouschromosomes.html');return false;">homologous chromosomes</a> consists of one chromosome inherited from the father and one from the mother. Here we have color-coded them blue and red. Each pair of chromosomes lines up independently of the other pairs in metaphase I of meiosis. Here you see one of the possible arrangements and outcomes. Click on the parent cell to rearrange the chromosomes and see a different arrangement and outcome.
