Despite their volcanic nature, most of the islands have some vegetation-- primarily grasses and shrubs, but several have trees, particularly in the higher locations. At the summits of the higher islands, water from the clouds that rest on the peaks condenses onto vegetation. How might this make the growing conditions quite different between the higher and lower elevations on these islands?
