Even though these islands are on the equator, they are not always hot. The climate is influenced by the Humboldt current, which brings cool water northward from Antarctica, and the north equatorial counter-current, which brings warmer water eastward past the islands. The Galapagos Islands usually have two seasons: a wet season and a dry season. For typical years, the wet season begins in December and lasts for about 5 months, but in some years no rain falls. Very wet years also occur every two to seven years. How do you think the wide fluctuations in precipitation might affect plant and animal life in the Galapagos?
