Darwin's experiences on his voyage lead him to think about the origin of new species, and the role of adaptation in that process. Read Darwin's quote shown here, and think about the following questions:<br>

<li>Why are so many unique kinds of plants and animals found on island groups? Does evolution occur faster on islands?
