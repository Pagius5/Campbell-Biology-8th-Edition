Charles Darwin was 22 years old when he sailed from Great Britain aboard HMS Beagle in December 1831. As the ship's naturalist, he observed and collected fauna and flora from around the world. One of the most unusual locations he visited was the Galapagos Islands. <br><br>The Galapagos Islands straddle the equator in the Eastern Pacific about 900 km west of the coast of Ecuador. In Darwin's time, whaling ships stopped there primarily to take on fresh water and food (tortoises) or to deposit or pick up mail from a box on the beach at Post Office Bay.
