The islands are relatively inhospitable; some areas are just barren lava. Darwin wrote, "Nothing could be less inviting than the first appearance. A broken field of black basaltic lava is everywhere covered by a stunted brushwood which shows little signs of life." Nonetheless, Darwin was very interested in studying the geology of the islands, since this was his first opportunity to see the crater of a volcano. Some of his observations on Chatham Island are provided here.
