Darwin was fascinated by the "imps of darkness": the marine iguanas. These lizards, which are unique to the Galapagos Islands, grow to a length of over one meter. Darwin noted that they were in fact a land animal that simply obtained its food from the ocean-- they eat only the seaweed or algae that grows on tidal rocks. Darwin also discovered a vegetarian land iguana.
