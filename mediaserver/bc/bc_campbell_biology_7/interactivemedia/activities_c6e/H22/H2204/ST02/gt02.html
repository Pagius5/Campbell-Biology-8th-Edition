<b>The Offer</b><p>When he returned home after graduation and a vacation, Darwin found two important letters waiting for him on August 29, 1831. One letter invited Darwin to become an unpaid naturalist on an exploratory voyage led by Captain FitzRoy on the H.M.S. Beagle starting in early October.  (H.M.S. = His Majesty's Ship) The purpose of the voyage was to complete a government survey of the "southern extremity of America."<p>The other letter was from his former professor, John Henslow, who explained why he had recommended Darwin:<br>"I have stated that I considered you to be the best qualified person I know of, &hellip; not on the supposition of your being a finished Naturalist, but as amply qualified for collecting, observing, and noting any thing worthy to be noted in natural history."<p>Darwin wrote to Henslow:<br>"As far as my own mind is concerned, I should, I think, certainly most gladly have accepted the opportunity, which you so kindly have offered me. &mdash; But my Father, although he does not decidedly refuse me, gives such strong advice against going. &mdash; that I should not be comfortable, if I did not follow it."<p>The next day Darwin told his close uncle, Josiah Wedgewood, about the offer. In contrast, Uncle Josiah thought the trip would be a wonderful opportunity. In addition, he had good answers to all of Charles' father's objections. He encouraged Darwin to write his father, answering the objections and asking him to reconsider.<p>Charles Darwin listed his father's objections to the voyage:<br>1. disreputable to my character as a Clergyman hereafter<br>2. a wild scheme<br>3. that they must have offered it to many others before me, the place of Naturalist<br>4. from its not being accepted there must be some serious objection to the vessel or expedition<br>5. that I should never settle down to a steady life hereafter<br>6. that my accommodations would be most uncomfortable<br>7. that you should consider it as again changing my profession<br>8. that it would be a useless undertaking.
