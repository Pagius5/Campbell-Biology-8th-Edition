<b>The Beagle</b><p>The Beagle, captained by Robert FitzRoy, was a rather small, ten-gun brig of 242 tons, 90 feet in length. She was being completely refitted and rebuilt after her last voyage. On the upcoming trip she would be home to 74 people including the captain, three officers, the crew, a doctor, an artist, and of course the naturalist. Darwin shared the poop cabin (at the back of the ship) with two officers. Their space was so cramped that Darwin had to remove a drawer each night so that he would have room for his feet.<p>The primary purpose of the voyage was to survey the waters around the southern coast of South America so as to improve the accuracy of charts (naval maps). Positions of landmarks, depths near shore, and the strength and locations of currents would be carefully measured and recorded. It was expected that the voyage would take two years, but it actually took five.
