<b>The Departure</b><p>Repairs to the Beagle took longer than expected. Darwin was ready to leave by the 24th of October, but the Beagle was not ready to leave until December 10th. After three attempts and three postponements because of bad weather, the Beagle set off from Plymouth harbor on December 27, 1831 at 2 p.m.<p>The bad weather that caused the Beagle's delayed departure was only a warning of what lay ahead.  For the next three weeks Darwin was miserable.<p>Darwin used the time to read Charles Lyell's new book "Principles of Geology," which Henslow had given him. Darwin was intrigued with Lyell's ideas based on uniformitarianism (see <A HREF="javascript:;" CLASS="cgConcept" ONCLICK="window.open('../geology.html','darwin','menubar=0,toolbar=1,location=0,status=1,scrollbars=1,resizable=1,width=650,height=400')">A Brief Survey of Geology</a>), and he looked forward to testing those ideas while on the voyage.
