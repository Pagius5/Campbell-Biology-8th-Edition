<b>The Job of the Naturalist</b><p>In Darwin's day, the job of a naturalist was to observe, record, and collect. All aspects of a location were important: the weather, landforms, flora, fauna, fossils, rocks, minerals, and native peoples. All observations were recorded in a journal. Many new species were identified, the behaviors of animals were described, and the ranges of various species were noted.<p>Many specimens were collected and carefully labeled and preserved. Plants or portions of plants were pressed and dried. Insects and spiders were killed and dried. Birds and mammals were skinned and stuffed, and occasionally their skulls or whole skeletons were cleaned and dried. Fish were gutted and salted. Many notes were needed because sizes, weights, and colors typically changed when specimens were preserved.<p>When visiting a new location, a naturalist would always note the weather patterns. These patterns produce the climate of a region, and they strongly affect the natural history of an area.<p>The accompanying graph shows the average precipitation and temperature for London, England. Such a graph, called a climatogram, is a compact way of presenting information about a climate. Darwin did not make climatograms, but they are used in this activity to help you understand the climates Darwin visited.<p>Available moisture is usually an important limiting factor for organisms. The available moisture depends on the precipitation patterns and temperature extremes.<p>Notice in the London climatogram that the temperature varies throughout the year, but that the distribution of precipitation is nearly uniform. Also, notice that the average temperature never dips below freezing nor does it get really hot in the summer. London and Kansas have similar yearly precipitations, but more moisture is available for plant communities in London because the temperature there is more moderate.
