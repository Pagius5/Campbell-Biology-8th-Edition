<b>What Darwin Did</b><p>In September of 1832, Darwin and FitzRoy discovered a major fossil site at Punta Alta in the Bay of Bahia. For one week he and helpers excavated the site. Darwin recognized the bones as being those of very large extinct mammals: a kind of armadillo, a type of tree sloth, and a Megatherium, a giant ground sloth. A fourth had large armored plates, which Darwin believed to be from a Megatherium, but later he found that this was a previously undiscovered species: a giant armadillo or glyptodont. Darwin labeled the bones and shipped them to England with specific instructions for Henslow to be careful with the labels when cleaning the fossils.<p>Darwin was puzzled by the fossil site at Punta Alta. The curious aspect of the site was that the mammal bones were embedded in a shell bed of very recent origin: the shells were identical to shells present in the adjacent bay. Here were the remains of apparently recently extinct, large mammals that had lived in the area.  Could the modern Pampas support such a fauna? How did the bones become deposited in shallow marine deposits? Darwin wasn't sure.<p>Darwin did note, however, that these bones were from mammals that were different from but similar to those currently in South America. "This wonderful relationship in the same continent between the dead and the living will, I do not doubt, hereafter throw more light on the appearance of organic beings on earth and their disappearance from it."
