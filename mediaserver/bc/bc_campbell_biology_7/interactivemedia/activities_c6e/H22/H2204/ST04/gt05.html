<b>Darwin's Observations and Reflections</b><p>Darwin commented on the abundance of insect life. He remarked that insects were so abundant that you could hear their calls while anchored several hundred yards from shore, but paradoxically deep in the forest it was strangely quiet.<p>Darwin's notes reflect his awe of the experience of walking through a rain forest. "&hellip;Delight itself, however, is a weak term to express the feelings of a naturalist who, for the first time, has wandered by himself in a Brazilian forest. The elegance of the grasses, the novelty of the parasitical plants, the beauty of the flowers, the glossy green of the foliage, but above all the general luxuriance of the vegetation, filled me with admiration."<p>"When quietly walking along shady pathways, and admiring each successive view, I wished to find language to express my ideas. Epithet after epithet was found too weak to convey to those who have not visited the intertropical regions, the sensation of delight which the mind experiences."
