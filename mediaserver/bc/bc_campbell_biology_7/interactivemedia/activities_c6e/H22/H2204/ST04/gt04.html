<b>What Darwin Did</b><p>The H.M.S. Beagle landed at Salvador, Brazil (Bahia) on February 29, 1832 and stayed until March 18th. This gave Darwin time to make several walks into the surrounding tropical forest and along the coast. During this time he collected hundreds of beetles.<p>Darwin's "walks" were actually mini-expeditions to explore and study natural history. Early on, Darwin realized the importance of his journals, and he maintained them diligently. He kept a small notebook with him at all times. By the end of the voyage, he had filled 18 notebooks. These notebooks were a resource for his more extensive journals that by the end of the voyage totaled more than 2,000 pages.
