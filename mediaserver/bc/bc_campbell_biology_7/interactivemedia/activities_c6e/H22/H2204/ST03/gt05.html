<b>Darwin's Observations and Reflections</b><p>Darwin commented on the volcanic nature and general bleakness of the landscape. He noted a curious white rock formation embedded in the volcanic flows. The white rock stretched for miles around the island in a nearly level plane about 45 feet above sea level. The thickness of the white rock seemed to be the same all around the island's cliffs.<p>Upon closer observation, Darwin noticed that the white rock was a bed of sea shells composed of many of the same species that were currently living in the waters around the island. The top of the bed seemed to have been modified by the heat of a lava flow that had occurred when the shells were still under the water.<p>Answer question 4.<p>Dry climates tend to produce very clear air. Darwin thought about the source of the haze in the air around the Cape Verde Islands. His idea that the haze was caused by dust from the Sahara was later confirmed by others. Darwin noted that small spores from plants could likewise make the journey to these islands.<p>Darwin thought a great deal about the geological history of the Cape Verde Islands. Given the position and condition of the shell bed, Darwin reasoned that the island (Saint Jago) must have been uplifted to its present location by gradual processes over a long period of time. Darwin came to this conclusion by using ideas that he had acquired from Lyell. <p>See <A HREF="javascript:;" CLASS="cgConcept" ONCLICK="window.open('../geology.html','darwin','menubar=0,toolbar=1,location=0,status=1,scrollbars=1,resizable=1,width=650,height=400')">A Brief Survey of Geology</a> for further information on how geologic principles affected Darwin's thinking.
