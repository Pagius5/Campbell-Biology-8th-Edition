<b>Introduction</b><p>In 1832 Charles Darwin took an unpaid job as a naturalist aboard a British survey ship, the Beagle. His voyage around the world changed his thinking about the history of life and changed the course of science. Who was Darwin before his voyage? What did he set out to do? What happened on the voyage? How did Darwin's ideas develop because of his experiences?<p>In this activity you have the opportunity to follow the Beagle's historic tour around the world. Eleven of the places that were the most significant for Darwin's thinking are featured.<p>At each of the eleven stops, you can learn a bit about that location, including its climate, and you will find out highlights of what Darwin did there and observed there.  Both at these stops and on the voyage from one location to another, you will gain an understanding of Darwin's thinking about what he observed, his questions, and his conclusions.
