<b>What Darwin Did</b><p>Darwin stayed near Rio de Janeiro from April until July in 1832. For two weeks in April, he accompanied a local Englishman on a visit to his estate about one hundred miles inland. Darwin did little collecting during this excursion, but he made many observations about the flora and fauna.<p>When the excursion was over, Darwin rented a small cottage about 4 mi. from Rio at the base of Mount Corcovado,which rose directly from the sea to a height of 2300 ft. This cottage served as a home base and laboratory for extensive natural history collecting and study.<p>In the rich, verdant tropical forests of Brazil, Darwin collected and studied many vertebrates (such as monkeys, jaguarundi, tree frogs, humming birds, etc.). He also spent a great deal of time collecting invertebrates, especially flatworms, butterflies, beetles, and spiders. He was a meticulous, hard-working observer, and he sent many of his specimens back to Henslow in Cambridge.
