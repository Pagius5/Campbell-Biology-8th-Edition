<b>Darwin's Observations</b><p>On his trip to the estate, Darwin encountered vampire bats, which bothered the horses at night. Most Europeans were skeptical of the possibility of such bizarre behavior. Darwin was able to document the behavior, and later in the voyage he was able to collect a vampire bat.<p>Darwin noted the incredible abundance of beetles, and that most were herbivorous. He noted the ubiquity of ants and observed both leaf-cutter ants and army ants in the field.<p>One group that Darwin began studying in Brazil were the flatworms. He collected and described many brightly colored terrestrial species. At the time, Europeans thought flatworms were strictly aquatic.<p>Darwin's mentor, Henslow, suggested that perhaps Darwin was mistaken, and that the flatworms were more likely slugs, members of the Mollusca. Darwin had been extremely careful in his observations and was convinced that the specimens were flatworms. Today, we know that Darwin was right.
