The voyage of the Beagle took approximately five years to complete.  For FitzRoy and the crew, most of this time was spent charting the waters of South America.  Because much of FitzRoy's work was repetitive, Darwin could and did spend large amounts of time on shore.  In fact, approximately three of the total five years, Darwin spent on land, often traveling far inland on expeditions for collecting and exploring.  From April to July of 1832, Darwin spent time near Rio de Janeiro while the Beagle surveyed the nearby coast.<p>In April 1832, the ship reached Rio de Janeiro, a coastal city in Brazil. The dominant plant community in this area is tropical rainforest.<p>Click on each button for more information.
