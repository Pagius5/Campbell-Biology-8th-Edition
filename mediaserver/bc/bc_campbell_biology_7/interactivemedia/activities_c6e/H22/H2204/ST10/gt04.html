<b>Darwin's Observations and Reflections</b><p>Darwin made several expeditions into the Andes to study their geology and, to a lesser extent, their biology. His primary goal was to check his ideas about the origin of the mountains. His first expedition was in August of 1834.<p>In March of 1835 Darwin made his most extensive expedition from Valparaiso to Santiago and then over the Andes via Portillo Pass to Mendoza. He returned by way of a different route through Uspallata Pass. This journey was late in the season and at altitudes exceeding 12,000 ft. Darwin had little altitude sickness, however, and he was blessed with good weather.<p>At elevations of 12,000 ft., Darwin found and collected fossilized marine shells. He also found "a clump of petrified trees, standing upright, with the layers of fine Sandstone deposited round them, bearing the impression of their bark." These fossil trees had obviously grown on land but later were buried with thousands of feet of sediment.<p>He wrote to his sister Susan that he had developed a theory to explain the formation of the Andes and could demonstrate that the age of these mountains was quite young&mdash;a serious claim from such a young geologist.<p>Most geologists of the time felt that a very early and very catastrophic period of earth's history accounted for the geologic formations evident on the surface of the planet. Lyell and Darwin felt that geologic processes identical to those in evidence today could account for all geologic structures, given enough time. Darwin brought all of these ideas together with his Andes trip. For the rest of his life, Darwin relied on this basic concept of gradual change accumulating over vast periods of time to account for and explain such concepts as the origin of species.<p>See <A HREF="javascript:;" CLASS="cgConcept" ONCLICK="window.open('../geology.html','darwin','menubar=0,toolbar=1,location=0,status=1,scrollbars=1,resizable=1,width=650,height=400')">A Brief Survey of Geology</a> for further information on how geologic principles affected Darwin's thinking.
