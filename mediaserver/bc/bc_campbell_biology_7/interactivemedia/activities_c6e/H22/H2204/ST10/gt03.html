<b>Tour of the Andes</b><p>The Andes Mountains run the length of South America; they dominate Chile, as well as several other countries. The highest peak in the Andes is over 22,000 ft. For every 1000 ft. of rise in elevation, the temperature decreases about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Thus, even at the equator in Equador, the peaks of the Andes are snow covered all year long.<p>Even the mid-elevations of the Andes are sparsely populated because air pressure decreases with the height above the earth. Altitude sickness, a combination of dizziness, headaches, and nausea caused by a lack of oxygen, affects some people as low as 10,000 ft. and most people at about 12,000 ft. and above.
