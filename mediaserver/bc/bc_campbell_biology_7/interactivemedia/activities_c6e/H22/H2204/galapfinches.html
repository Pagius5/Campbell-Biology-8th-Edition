		"A group of finches, of which Mr. Gould considers there are thirteen species; and these he has distributed into four new sub-genera.  These birds are the most singular of any in the archipelago.  They all agree in many points; namely, in a peculiar structure of their bill, short tails, general form, and in their plumage.  The females are gray or brown, but the old cocks jet-black.  All the species, excepting two, feed in flocks on the ground, and have very similar habits.  It is very remarkable that a nearly perfect gradation of structure in this one group can be traced in the form of the beak, from one exceeding in dimensions that of the largest grosbeak, to another differing but little from that of a warbler."
