	  <TD WIDTH="350" VALIGN="TOP">

	    Some people have always been fascinated by the surface features of the earth, such as mountains and valleys, rivers, lakes, and flat lands.  These topics are part of geology, which also includes the study of minerals, rocks, and fossils.  

	    <P>

	      In the 1700s and 1800s, more people thought about and tried to develop scientific explanations for the origins of these features.  Charles Hutton is credited with the introduction of the basic ideas of geology in 1785.

	    <B>The Development of Geological Ideas</B>

	  </TD>

	  <TD WIDTH="350" VALIGN="TOP">

	    In most cases, geological explanations were introduced many years before those ideas later became widely known or accepted.  Thus, one individual may have first proposed an idea, and then another individual may have applied the idea and argued extensively for its acceptance within the scientific community.  For example, James Hutton is credited with the development of the principle of uniformitarianism, but Charles Lyell is known for establishing that idea within geology.

	  <TD WIDTH="350" VALIGN="TOP">

	    As in all sciences, competing and conflicting ideas were often developed in geology.  This was because the alternatives were reasonably possible given the knowledge of that era.  Time was needed for individuals to test to see which of the ideas were consistent with observations in many different locations.  It is this testing of ideas for consistency with reality that characterizes science.

	  <TD WIDTH="350" VALIGN="TOP">

	    <A NAME="horizontal"></A>

	    <B>Principle of Original Horizontality (1669)</B><BR>

	    Sediments in marine environments are deposited in horizontal layers that later may form rock strata.  These strata may be tilted, bent or otherwise transformed.  Nevertheless, the position of original horizontality is a key reference point for understanding a particular geological deposit.

	    <P>

	      <A NAME="superposition"></A>

	      <B>Principle of Superpostion (1669)</B><BR>

	      Undisturbed rock strata record a sequential history of deposits, with the youngest deposits on top of older deposits.  Using this principle geologists can determine the relative ages of various rock strata.

	    <P>

	      <A NAME="faunal"></A>

	      <B>Law of Faunal Succession</B><BR>

	      Rock strata (rock layers) have characteristic groups of fossils that provide an index for identification and comparison with other rock strata.  The groups of fossils vary through the rock column in a predictable way.  This principle, along with the Principle of Superposition, allows a geologist to deduce the relative age of the rock strata.

	    <P>

	      <A NAME="cycle"></A>

	      <B>Geologic Cycle (1785)</B><BR>

	      The geologic cycle refers to the changes that occur in earth's material--rock.  In the 1700s and 1800s, rocks were grouped into two basic groups or families: stratified rocks (which we now classify as sedimentary and metamorphic) and unstratified rocks (which we now classify as igneous).  The processes of erosion, deposition, and lithification were understood to form stratified rock.  The processes of melting  and cooling were understood to form unstratified rock.  According to James Hutton:  This world is thus destroyed in one part, but it is renewed in another; and the operations by which this world is thus constantly renewed are as evident to the scientific eye, as are those in which it is necessarily destroyed.

	    <P>

	      <A NAME="catastrophe"></A>

	      <B>Catastrophism (1700s)</B><BR>

	      Some geologists of the 1700s felt that catastrophic events must have been the primary causes of the current features on earth.  In particular, one or several floods were suggested to be the main events that affected the distribution of rocks and organisms.  

	    <P>

	      The counter theory to catastrophism is uniformitarianism.  Most modern geologists realize that past earth history is influenced by catastrophic events such as asteroid or comet impacts in addition to the geologic processes associated with gradual, uniform change.

	    <P>

	      <A NAME="uniform"></A>

	      <B>Uniformitarianism (1788)</B><BR>

	      This principle states that geological processes operate today in much the same way as in the past.  The idea of uniformitarianism was introduced by James Hutton and championed by Charles Lyell.  By understanding the geological process that occur today and extrapolating their effects over long periods of time (uniformity) then the geological features of the earth could be explained.  The key here is long periods of time.  Uniformitarianism was a novel and powerful idea for the 18th and 19th century.

	    <P>

	      <A NAME="uplift"></A>

	      <B>Uplift and Depression</B><BR>

	      Geologists had noted that in many areas, the rocks on land held fossils of marine organisms.  This condition could be interpreted in several ways:  either a previous ocean had receded, or the land had been uplifted.  In the 1800s many arguments were made for each explanation.  

	    <P>

	      Evidence for the depression of land was less obvious, and in the 1800s fewer individuals thought that this was possible.
