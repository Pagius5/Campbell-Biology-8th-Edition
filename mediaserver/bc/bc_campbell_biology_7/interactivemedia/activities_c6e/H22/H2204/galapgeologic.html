		"The surface of this part of the island seems to be punctured like a skimmer by subterranean steam; here and there, the lava, still soft, has puffed up in giant bubbles; elsewhere, the roof of the caverns thus formed has collapsed and one can see in the middle a well with perpendicular sides.  The common shape of these numerous craters gives an artificial aspect to the land which reminds me of the furnaces of Staffordshire.  It was incredibly hot.  I felt extremely tired to walk on this rough surface,  but the strange scene of this cyclopean country compensated far beyond my tiredness."
