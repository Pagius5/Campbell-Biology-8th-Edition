<b>Darwin's Observations and Reflections</b><p>A large, wolf-like fox was native to the Falkland Islands, living off of the abundant bird population. Darwin remarked on the fox's lack of fear of humans, which is typical of the behavior of animals on remote islands. Darwin tried to take one of these foxes back to England, but it died before they returned. He noted that this fox was unique to the Falkland Islands.<p>"As far as I am aware, there is no other instance in any part of the world, of so small a mass of broken land, distant from a continent, possessing so large an aboriginal quadruped peculiar to itself. Their numbers have rapidly decreased; &hellip;Within a few years after these islands shall become regularly settled, in all probability this fox will be classed with the dodo, as an animal which has perished from the face of the earth."<p>Darwin was right. The fox is now extinct.<p>Think about why island species tend to be smaller or larger than their mainland counterparts: Organisms compete with each other for resources such as prey species. This competition might be interspecific (between different species) or intraspecific (within the same species). In addition, species in hot climates tend to have a larger surface to volume ratio compared with species in cold climates.<p>Answer questions 19 and 20.
