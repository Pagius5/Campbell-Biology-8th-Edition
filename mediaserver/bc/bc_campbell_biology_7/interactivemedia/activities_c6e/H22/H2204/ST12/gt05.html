<b>Darwin's Observations and Reflections</b><p>On Chatham Island Darwin noted several black volcanic cones and red slag from older volcanoes. He compared the scenery to the iron foundries around Staffordshire, England. Fascinated by the various forms of the lava, he wondered about their ages.<p>Darwin commented: "The natural history of this archipelago is very remarkable: it seems to be a little world within itself; the greater number of its inhabitants, both vegetable and animal, being found nowhere else."<p>Darwin was fascinated by the "imps of darkness": the marine iguanas. He noted that they were in fact a land animal that simply obtained its food from the ocean. These lizards are vegetarians and eat only the seaweed or algae that grows on tidal rocks. As Darwin traveled from Chatham Island to Albemarle Island, he discovered a land iguana that was also a vegetarian.<p>Walking along examining the island's craters, Darwin came upon two large tortoises&#8212;each of which weighed at least two hundred pounds. One was eating a piece of cactus, and when I approached, it looked at me, and then quietly walked away: the other gave a deep hiss and drew in its head."<p>Darwin commented:<br>"The natural history of these islands is eminently curious, and well deserves attention. Most of the organic productions are aboriginal creations, found nowhere else; there is even a difference between the inhabitants of the different islands; yet all show a marked relationship with those of America, though separated from that continent by an open space of ocean, between 500 and 600 miles in width. The archipelago is a little world within itself, or rather a satellite attached to America, whence it has derived a few stray colonists, and has received the general character of its indigenous productions."<p>"Considering the small size of these islands, we feel the more astonished at the number of their aboriginal beings, and at their confined range. Seeing every height crowned with its crater, and the boundaries of most of the lava-streams still distinct, we are led to believe that within a period, geologically recent, the unbroken ocean was here spread out. Hence, both in space and time, we seem to be brought somewhere near to that great fact&mdash;that mystery of mysteries&mdash;the first appearance of new beings on this earth."<p>Study the photos and answer questions 25 and 26.
