<b>What Darwin Did</b><p>From September through October 1835, Darwin and the Beagle spent five weeks exploring four of the larger islands. At the time, Darwin was most interested in studying the geology of the islands. This was his first opportunity to see the crater of a volcano.<p><A HREF="javascript:;" CLASS="cgConcept" ONCLICK="window.open('../galapgeologic.html','darwin','menubar=0,toolbar=1,location=0,status=1,scrollbars=1,resizable=1,width=400,height=400')">Some of Darwin's Geologic Observations on Chatham Island</a><p>
In some areas of the islands, the wildlife was quite abundant, and everywhere it was unusual. The tameness of the animals and the presence of many exotic species prompted Darwin to collect many specimens and to make extensive notes on the flora and fauna.<p>Darwin is famous for having collected quite a few small, rather plain finches that seemed to be related, but which came from different habitats and different islands. He sent these to England to be studied by Mr. Gould at the British Museum. Eventually, 13 distinct species of Galapagos finches were identified.<p><A HREF="javascript:;" CLASS="cgConcept" ONCLICK="window.open('../galapfinches.html','darwin','menubar=0,toolbar=1,location=0,status=1,scrollbars=1,resizable=1,width=400,height=400')">Darwin's Description of the Galapagos Finches</a>
