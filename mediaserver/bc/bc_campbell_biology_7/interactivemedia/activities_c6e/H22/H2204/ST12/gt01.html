<b>About the Galapagos Islands</b><p>As the Beagle left South America and headed for the Galapagos Islands, everyone aboard knew they were leaving behind the most difficult part of the trip. Spirits lifted as they sailed into warmer weather and less demanding days.<p>Darwin longed to return to England, but he also had reason to look forward to the Galapagos Islands: "I look forward to the Galapagos with more interest than any other part of the voyage. They abound with Volcanoes &amp; I should hope contain Tertiary strata."<p>The Galapagos Islands straddle the equator in the Eastern Pacific about 500 mi. west of the coast of Ecuador. The islands were uninhabited when they were discovered in 1535 by the Bishop of Panama, Fray Tomas de Berlanga. In Darwin's time, whaling ships stopped there primarily to take on fresh water and food (tortoises) or to deposit or pick up mail from a box on the beach at Post Office Bay.<p>Click on each button for more information.
