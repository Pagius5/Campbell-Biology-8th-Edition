<b>Climate</b><p>Even though these islands are on the equator, they are not always hot. The climate is influenced by fluctuations in the Humboldt current, which brings cool water northward from Antarctica, and in the north equatorial counter-current, which brings warmer water eastward past the islands.<p>The Galapagos Islands usually have two seasons: a wet season and a dry season. For typical years, the "wet season" begins in December and lasts for about 5 months, but in some years (such as 1977) no rain falls.<p>Very wet years also occur every two to seven years, associated with an ocean and weather pattern known as El Nino. In 1983, the Galapagos experienced the strongest El Nino event in recorded history. Rain fell incessantly, and by the end of the year more than four times the record annual rainfall had fallen.<p>Use the graph to answer questions 23 and 24.
