<b>The Return to England</b><p>From the Keeling Islands, the Beagle sailed to the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa and then north, stopping at several islands in the Atlantic as well as returning briefly to Salvador, Brazil.<p>At Ascension Island, Darwin received a letter from his sister, telling him about how his reputation as a scientist had emerged while he was on the voyage. Much of what Darwin had written to his former professor, Henslow, had been published and read to the Cambridge Philosophical Society before Darwin returned. The letters, along with Darwin's collections of plants, animals, and fossils, had preceded his return to England and had cemented Darwin's name on the list of noted naturalists.<p>When the Beagle returned to Falmouth, England, on October 2, 1836, Charles Darwin immediately returned to his family home, The Mount, exactly five years and three days after having left it.<p>Darwin spent the next few years writing about the voyage and classifying his collections. With the help of Henslow and Lyell he received a grant to help finance his work. Six months after the voyage, as he wrote about the tortoises and birds of the Galapagos and about the fox of the Falklands, Darwin started to have some "vague doubts" about the stability of species.<p>Over the ensuing years, Darwin's thoughts returned frequently to his voyage, particularly to the varieties of organisms on the Galapagos Islands and to the geology of South America and the Pacific Islands. The "vague doubts" were kept alive and grew.<p>From his study at Down House, in Kent, England, Darwin developed his ideas about natural selection. In addition to reflecting on his past observations, he conducted investigations to help him clarify his "Idea" about changes in species. Most days he spent some time walking in the nearby woods, thinking planning, and composing.<p>For twenty years Darwin thought, studied, and wrote until in the middle 1850's he brought his ideas together. The first printing of his treatise "On the Origin Of Species by Means Of Natural Selection" was sold out on the first day of publication, November 24, 1859. <A HREF="javascript:;" CLASS="cgConcept" ONCLICK="window.open('../lines.html','darwin','menubar=0,toolbar=1,location=0,status=1,scrollbars=1,resizable=1,width=400,height=400')">Opening Lines of the Origin of Species</a>
