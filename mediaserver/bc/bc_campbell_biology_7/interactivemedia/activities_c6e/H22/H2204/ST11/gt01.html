<b>About the Coast of Chile</b><p>From November 1834 to February 1835, the ship explored the coast of Chile. Concepcion is a coastal city in the middle of Chile about halfway from Valparaiso, to the north, and Ancud, to the South.<p>The southern coast of Chile has many gulfs, bays, peninsulas, and islands of various sizes. Ancud is on the largest island, Chiloe. The total annual precipitation there averages more than 96 inches, similar to the Olympic peninsula in the state of Washington. This climate allows the growth of a temperate rainforest biome.<p>The northern coast of Chile is desert, the central coast is agricultural, and the southern coast is wooded. The Andes stretch the length of Chile, along its eastern border.<p>Click on each button for more information.
