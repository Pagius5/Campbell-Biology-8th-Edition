<b>Darwin's Observations and Reflections</b><p>In November of 1834, the Beagle sailed south from Valparaiso to survey the southern coast. On Chiloe Island, Darwin tried to climb to the summit in the rainforest but was unable to because of the dense vegetation.<p>On the night of January 19, 1835, the Beagle was anchored in a bay between Chiloe Island and the mainland. One hundred miles inland a volcano, Mount Osorno, erupted. Darwin and the crew were able to observe the spectacular eruption safely through telescopes.<p>A month later on February 20th the Beagle was anchored in the small harbor of Valdivia. Darwin was on shore, lying down when a large earthquake occurred. The quake was centered further north near Concepcion. When the Beagle later sailed there in early March, Darwin and FitzRoy witnessed the extreme destruction wrought by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunamis, the huge sea waves caused by the earthquake.<p>Darwin made many observations of the flora and fauna in Chile, but his experience of the volcanic eruption and earthquake were more pivotal.<p>The eruption of Mount Osorno: "At midnight the sentry observed something like a large star, which gradually increased in size till about three o'clock, when it presented a very magnificent spectacle. By the aid of a glass, dark objects, in constant succession, were seen, in the midst of a great glare of red light, to be thrown up and to fall down. The light was sufficient to cast on the water a long bright reflection. Large masses of molten matter seem very commonly to be cast out of the craters in this part of the Cordillera."<p>A month later, Darwin felt the earthquake, but he did not see its effects until two weeks later when he reached the area near Concepcion. It and the nearby towns were totally ruined: the walls of all the buildings had fallen and uncontrolled fires had started wherever thatched roofs fell on cooking fires. Large blocks of crustal material (seafloor) had been displaced upward out of the ocean and were now dry land. FitzRoy made extensive measurements and documented the event: some of the original seabed of the harbor had actually risen about eight feet.<p>Darwin commented: "A bad earthquake at once destroys our oldest associations: the earth, the very emblem of solidity, has moved beneath our feet like a thin crust over a fluid;&mdash;one second of time has created in the mind a strange idea of insecurity, which hours of reflection would not have produced."<p>After the eruption of Mount Osorno, Darwin was surprised to hear that two other volcanoes in the Andes had erupted at almost the same time: Aconcagua, 480 miles to the north, and Conseguina, over 2700 miles farther north (six hours later). To Darwin, this was a clue that the mechanisms elevating the mountain chain were connected and acting throughout the entire range.<p>Darwin had been seeking some sort of confirmation of the theories of uniformitarianism, which included crustal elevation. The volcanic events followed by the earthquake verified for him the existence of processes that could gradually raise the Andes. Darwin was now increasingly confident that Lyell's way of looking at earth history had merit: given enough time, volcanism and earthquakes could account for the formation of exceedingly high mountains.<p>Answer question 22.<p>See <A HREF="javascript:;" CLASS="cgConcept" ONCLICK="window.open('../geology.html','darwin','menubar=0,toolbar=1,location=0,status=1,scrollbars=1,resizable=1,width=650,height=400')">A Brief Survey of Geology</a> for further information on how geologic principles affected Darwin's thinking.
