		"The ring-formed reef of the lagoon-island is surmounted in the greater part of its length by linear islets.  On the northern or leeward side, there is an opening through which vessels can pass to the anchorage within.  On entering, the scene was very curious and rather pretty; its beauty, however entirely depended on the brilliancy of the surrounding colours.  The shallow, clear, and still water of the lagoon, resting in its greater part on white sand, is, when illumined by a vertical sun, of the most vivid green.  This brilliant expanse, several miles in width, is on all sides divided, either by a line of snow-white breakers from the dark heaving waters of the ocean, or from the blue vault of heaven by the strips of land, crowned by the level tops of cocoa-nut trees."
