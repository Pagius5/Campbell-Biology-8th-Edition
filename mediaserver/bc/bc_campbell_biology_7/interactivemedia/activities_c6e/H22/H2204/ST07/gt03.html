<b>Darwin's Observations</b><p>As the Beagle sailed south and north along the Patagonian coast, Darwin had ample time to study the rock formation that made up almost 1200 miles of the coast. The formation was up to 800 feet thick, and it contained many fossils of marine organisms. Relying on Lyell, Darwin speculated that the deposit had been laid down in shallow seas and had been uplifted to its present elevation. The extent and integrity of the exposed, layered deposits convinced Darwin that the uplift had been gradual. If a catastrophic event had elevated the formation, it surely would have not been so uniform for the whole length of the continent. Again Darwin had more evidence for gradual change.<p>At Port Desire, a few days after Christmas in 1833, one of the crew shot a small rhea and prepared it for dinner. It wasn't until after the meal that Darwin suddenly realized that this might be an elusive southern rhea that he had hoped to collect. He was able to salvage enough of the bones of the bird as a specimen, and it was later identified as a new species. It was named after Darwin, <i>Rhea darwinii</i>.
