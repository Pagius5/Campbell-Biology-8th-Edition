		"September 15, 1835--  This archipelago consists of ten principal islands, of which five exceed the others in size.  They are situated under the Equator, and between five and six hundred miles westward of the coast of America.  They are all formed of volcanic rocks; a few fragments of granite curiously glazed and altered by the heat, can hardly be considered as an exception.  Some of the craters, surmounting the larger islands, are of immense size, and they rise to a height of between three and four thousand feet.  Their flanks are studded by innumerable smaller orifices.  I scarcely hesitate to affirm, that there must be in the whole archipelago at least two thousand craters."

		"In the morning (17th,) we landed on Chatham Island, which, like the others, rises with a tame and rounded outline, interrupted only here and there by scattered hillocks--the remains of former craters.  Nothing could be less inviting than the first appearance.  A broken field of black basaltic lava is every where covered by a stunted brushwood which shows little signs of life."
