<b>About the Keeling Islands</b><p>After leaving the Galapagos, the Beagle traveled for 25 days across the open Pacific to the South Pacific island of Tahiti, where Darwin thoroughly enjoyed exploring the islands. From Tahiti, the Beagle sailed on for three more weeks to New Zealand. Darwin's sea-sickness returned, and he now became very homesick, longing for the voyage to end. In New Zealand, Darwin was not much impressed with the exotic flora and fauna.<p>The Beagle also stopped in Australia. Then after two weeks of sailing, they reached the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean where Darwin hoped to explore coral reefs.<p>The Keeling Islands are northwest of Australia in the Indian Ocean. Also known as the Cocos Islands, they are similar to many groups of tropical islands in the South Pacific.<p>The Keeling Islands include about 27 islands, all with white sandy beaches and coconut trees. The islands are part of an atoll, a circular land mass that rises a few feet out of the ocean and encircles a lagoon.<p>The South Pacific has hundreds of similar coral atolls east of Australia. These islands seem to rise out of nowhere in the ocean. In many cases the surrounding ocean floor is thousands of feet deep.<p><A HREF="javascript:;" CLASS="cgConcept" ONCLICK="window.open('../keelingdescrip.html','darwin','menubar=0,toolbar=1,location=0,status=1,scrollbars=1,resizable=1,width=400,height=400')">Darwin's Description of the Keeling Islands</a><p>The yearly average temperature in the Keeling Islands is 84&deg; F, and monthly averages may be 5 degrees cooler or warmer. August is the coolest month of the year; October and November have hot humid conditions (known as the doldrums); and December to April is the cyclone season when heavy rains may fall.<p>Much of the habitat of the Keeling Islands consists of coral reefs underwater. The reefs are affected as much by the water currents as by the surface climate. <p>Click on each button for more information.
