<b>What Darwin Did</b><p>On April 1, 1836, the Beagle arrived at Cocos-Keeling and stayed for 10 days. The crew relaxed and fished as Darwin explored the vegetation, noted the wildlife, and investigated the reef surrounding the islands. Darwin had FitzRoy help him use a weight with a moldable surface to investigate the seabed at various depths on the outside of the atoll. He did this to investigate a hypothesis about the formation of atolls.
