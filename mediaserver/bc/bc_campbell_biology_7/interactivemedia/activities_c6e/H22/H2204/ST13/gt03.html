<b>Darwin's Observations and Reflections</b><p>Darwin noted the very few types of plants and animals that lived on the islands and how well adapted they were. He was amazed by a crab that could pierce coconuts to eat the meat inside. The land itself was composed entirely of rounded fragments of coral, producing a loose, dry stony soil.<p>The surrounding water, by contrast, had numerous kinds of corals and fish with different ones on the outside and inside of the atoll. On the outside of the atoll, Darwin found that coral grew down to a depth of about 120 ft., but not much farther.<p>Darwin reflected on the explanations for the presence of atolls that other scientists had suggested. One common belief in Darwin's time was that the "coral insect", a soft-bodied polyp that forms colonies, simply builds its colony of limy secretions from the ocean floor at whatever its depth. Over the many thousands of years, the atolls form from this buildup.<p>From his investigations, Darwin thought that instead the coral had probably first formed as a circular reef in the shallow waters around a small island. Eventually the island started to sink as the ocean floor subsided. The coral continued to grow upward, maintaining the circular reef at the right height for growth, as the island sank. Today, the original island is submerged, but portions of the reef remain as the islands of the atoll.<p>The full details of the formation of a coral atoll were published by Darwin in his 1842 book, "The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs." This volume is still today considered to be one of Charles Darwin's most significant contributions.
