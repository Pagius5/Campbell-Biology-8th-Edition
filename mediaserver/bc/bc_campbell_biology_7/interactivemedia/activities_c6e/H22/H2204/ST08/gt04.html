<b>What Darwin Did</b><p>On a previous voyage, Captain FitzRoy had captured four natives of Tierra del Fuego. Three of these Fuegians became known as York Minister, Jemmy Button, and Fuegia Basket. FitzRoy had taken the four Fuegians to England, where they learned English and adopted English culture and the Anglican religion. The Beagle made two separate trips to Tierra del Fuego. On the first trip from December 1832 to February 1933, the three Fuegians and a missionary named Matthews stayed on shore to found a mission. The site selected was Woollya, in the home territory of Jemmy Button.<p>For the next several weeks, the Beagle (with Darwin on board) continued survey work near Woollya. Several times Darwin went ashore to collect plants and study the vegetation. When the Beagle returned to Woollya after 10 days, the missionary, Matthews, rejoined the ship and refused to go back ashore. Two of the British Fuegians had returned to their people and all of the provisions for the mission had been taken. Jemmy did not want to leave his people and native land a second time.<p>A year later (in February of 1834) the Beagle returned for more survey work before heading into the Pacific and the west coast of South America. FitzRoy was able to reconnect with Jemmy, who had re-adapted to his native culture.
