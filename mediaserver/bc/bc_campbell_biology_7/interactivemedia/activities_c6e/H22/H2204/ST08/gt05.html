<b>Darwin's Observations and Reflection</b><p>All through the channels of Tierra del Fuego, the Beagle encountered the various tribes of Fuegians, some in well-made cloaks of skins, and others with little or nothing for clothes at all. Darwin saw their simple skin huts and how they slept on the wet ground. He was amazed that they could survive the miserable weather.<p>Darwin watched the meeting of the Fuegians with FitzRoy, and he noted how well the Fuegians could mimic actions and remember foreign words. He listened to their guttural language and saw their hunter-gatherer existence.<p>When he returned in 1834, Darwin saw Jemmy "now a thin haggard savage, with long disordered hair, and naked, except a bit of a blanket round his waist&hellip; . We had left him plump, fat, clean and well dressed;&mdash;I never saw so complete and grievous a change." Yet Darwin noted how Jemmy was willing to come on board the ship, generously gave presents, and was able to eat with the Captain as tidily as before.<p>For a full year Darwin had interacted with the three Fuegians on the Beagle. He had witnessed how these previously primitive people had taken on English culture. He also noted how quickly civilized people (including himself) adapted to primitive conditions.<p>His interaction with the Anglicised Fuegians and with slavery convinced Darwin that all peoples were "made of the same clay". He came to understand there to be no inborn inferiority or superiority&mdash;to him the differences were primarily cultural differences.<p>According to Browne, "And of all Darwin's varied experiences during the voyage, it was this recognition of the connections between humans around the world that moved him the most: more than the geology or zoology, more than the starts over the Andes, or even the lush abandonment of the tropics&hellip;"
