Biologists use similarities in animal and plant structures to provide evidence of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('evolution.html');return false;">evolution</a>. Comparing the bones of corresponding structures in animals reveals a common ancestry even if the structures appear unrelated. For example, the arm of a human and the fin of a whale look unalike. Yet, they are composed of the same types of bones organized in the same arrangement. The term <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('homologous.html');return false;">homologous</a> describes structures that have a similar origin or ancestry. Homologous structures develop from the same parts in the embryos. In this activity, you can perform the type of comparative anatomy studies used to look at the evolutionary relationships between organisms.
