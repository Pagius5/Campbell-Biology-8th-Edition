Read the text and then click on the triangle to play the video. (The video is visual only, without narration.)<br><br>The pygmy sea horses in this clip were filmed in Lembeh Straight in Indonesia. They are seen in their habitat among a distinctive type of coral. The sea horses look very much like the coral, which might serve as camouflage, or to lure prey into the seeming safety of the branching coral. Darwinian theory says that better-camouflaged sea horses have better reproductive success, and thus pass on more of the genes underlying the camouflage pattern. This would account for the evolution of the striking likeness between this pygmy sea horse and its habitat.
