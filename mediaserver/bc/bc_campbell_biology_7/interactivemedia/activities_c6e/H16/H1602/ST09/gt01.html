RNA usually consists of a single polynucleotide chain.  DNA, on the other hand, consists of two polynucleotide chains. The two DNA chains, or strands, are oriented in opposite directions and held together by hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases on opposite strands. Because of their sizes, shapes, and arrangement of polar groups, the DNA bases form complementary pairs. Adenine pairs with thymine, and cytosine pairs with guanine.
