Replication of a DNA molecule begins at a specific sequence called an <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('originofreplication.html');return false;">origin of replication</a>.  The two strands separate, forming a small replication bubble.<br><br>DNA replication starts and then proceeds in both directions until the original DNA molecule is completely replicated.
