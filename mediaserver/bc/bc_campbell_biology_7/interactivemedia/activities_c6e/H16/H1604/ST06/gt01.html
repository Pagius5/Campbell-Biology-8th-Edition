Because <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('dnapolymerases.html');return false;"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('dna.html');return false;">DNA</a> polymerases</a> can only assemble new DNA in the 5' to 3' direction, only half of the new DNA can be synthesized in one continuous piece. The other half is synthesized in short pieces. As the replication bubbles grow, one daughter strand is synthesized continuously, while the other daughter strand is synthesized in pieces. The pieces are joined together by the enzyme <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('dnaligase.html');return false;">DNA ligase</a>. Eventually, all the replication bubbles merge, yielding two identical daughter DNA molecules.
