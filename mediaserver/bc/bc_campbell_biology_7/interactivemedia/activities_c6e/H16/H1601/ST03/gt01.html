When T2 comes in contact with <i>E. coli</i>, the phage attaches to the bacterium by its tail. Next, the phage injects genetic material into the cell. The genetic material directs bacterial enzymes to produce viral offspring.<p>When the life cycle is complete, 100 to 200 progeny phages have been assembled inside each bacterium.  The bacterium breaks open, or lyses, and the phages are released.
