The other new strand is called the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('laggingstrand.html');return false;">lagging strand</a>. Unlike the leading strand, the lagging strand cannot be made continuously because DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides at the 3 prime end. Instead, the lagging strand must be made of fragments that are linked together. Despite their names, the leading and lagging strands are actually made at the same time. For clarity, here we will just show the lagging strand being pieced together.<br><br>We'll start with a brief overview of fragments being formed and linked. First, an RNA <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('primer.html');return false;">primer</a>, shown here in red, forms the beginning of each fragment. The rest of each fragment is then synthesized from DNA nucleotides in a 5 prime to 3 prime direction. The resulting segments are called Okazaki fragments. Next, each RNA primer is replaced with DNA. Then the gaps are closed to form the lagging strand.
