The figure contains a carbon "skeleton" of four carbon atoms. Below the carbon skeleton is a "pool" of hydrogen atoms. Click on a hydrogen atom, hold down the mouse button, and drag toward the carbon skeleton to move a hydrogen atom into position. Release the mouse when you think the H is close to where it belongs in order to occupy one of the valence positions of a carbon atom. If you are correct, the hydrogen atom will snap into position and form a covalent bond. If you are incorrect, it will return to the pool. See if you can place all the hydrogen atoms needed to complete the valence requirements of carbon. Click on the "Submit" button to check your answer.
