The two <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('electronegative.html');return false;">electronegative</a> oxygens of this group pull electrons away from the hydrogen atom. This weakens the bond between oxygen and hydrogen, and the hydrogen atom tends to dissociate from the molecule as a hydrogen (H<sup>+</sup>) ion. Because it donates hydrogen ions, this group is acidic, and molecules that contain these groups are known as carboxylic acids. Click on the functional group just described.
