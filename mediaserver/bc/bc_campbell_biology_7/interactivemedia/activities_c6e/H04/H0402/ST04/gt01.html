This activity will help you review the different kinds of isomers. Are these two molecules structural isomers, geometric isomers, or <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('enantiomers.html');return false;">enantiomers</a>? Or is it possible that they are not isomers at all? Select your answer from the pull-down menu; a tone will tell you whether you have answered correctly. Click on another number at the bottom to see another pair of molecules. Note that you can facilitate your comparisons by clicking on the arrows to rotate the molecules. Also note that in this activity only, a double bond is shown as a white rod. Study each pair of molecules carefully before choosing an answer.
