Correct! Root hairs make CO<sub>2</sub> molecules during respiration. CO<sub>2</sub> molecules diffuse into the soil, where they combine with water to release H<sup>+</sup> and carbonate (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) ions. The H<sup>+</sup> ions bind to soil particles and displace positive mineral ions. Positive ions are called cations, so this process is called cation exchange. Roots also spend ATP to pump H<sup>+</sup> ions directly from the root to the soil.
