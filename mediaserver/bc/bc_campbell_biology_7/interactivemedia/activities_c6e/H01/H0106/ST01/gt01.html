This simple animation illustrates the principle of negative feedback, or feedback inhibition, in the regulation of a chemical reaction sequence in a cell. The sequence involves four molecules, A, B, C, and D.  Three different enzymes catalyze the conversion of one molecule to the next. <br><br>The final product, D, inhibits the first enzyme in the sequence; when the concentration of D rises to a certain point, the reaction shuts itself down.
