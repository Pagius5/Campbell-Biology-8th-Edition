DDT was banned in the United States based on the known and potential harm it has on humans and wildlife.  Alternative, but more expensive, pesticides and insect control technologies that cause less environmental and health damage are currently used.   However, these pesticides and technologies are also being pulled from use because they have been shown to be potentially harmful.  The costs of replacing these pesticides are reflected in higher costs to farmers and consumers.
