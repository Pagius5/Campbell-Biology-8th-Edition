DDT is one of several insecticides available to treat insects plaguing agricultural animals.  It is very inexpensive compared to the other insecticides.  It is probably more effective at killing insects than the other insecticides.  There are other practices used today in cattle raising that reduce the need for pesticides.  However, they are expensive to implement and maintain.  DDT has been very effective in the past at controlling insects that spread diseases from one animal to another as well as from animals to humans.
