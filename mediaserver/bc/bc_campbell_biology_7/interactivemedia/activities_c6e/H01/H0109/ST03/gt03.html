Using DDT to control agricultural pests in Africa has the added benefit of containing insects that spread diseases from agricultural animals and wildlife to humans. It was very successful in controlling malaria and sleeping sickness in many parts of Africa.  These diseases have a high mortality rate and are very difficult and expensive to treat.  The health effects of long-term exposure to DDT in humans are not evident in Africa.
