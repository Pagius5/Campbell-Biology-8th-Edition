Africa is not immune to the negative impact of DDT.  Many species of birds and small mammals have been decimated by DDT.  If the DDT did not kill the animals outright, it caused severe birth defects that reduced their populations.  DDT may also harm African children by causing reproductive defects when the DDT is ingested from foods and from their mothers' milk.  DDT is known to accumulate in the fats of animals and may pass from the meat and milk to the children.
