Pesticide applications are still a common method of controlling insects that attack agricultural animals and crops.  Many areas use pesticides to eliminate organisms known to spread deadly diseases to people.  Unfortunately, pesticides are not only harmful to the pests they are designed to kill.  They also harm other animals including humans. The decision to use pesticides involves comparing the benefits and risks of using the pesticide.  All pesticides used throughout the world today pose risks.  However, their current use in some areas indicates that their perceived benefits outweigh the risks. This activity will ask you to make a decision about the use of an insecticide called DDT.  In two case studies, one in the United States and one in Africa, you will investigate whether DDT is an appropriate insecticide.
