It is difficult to make decisions about human activities that have an impact on the environment.  When faced with this challenge, governments commonly use a decision model that compares the costs and benefits of using a technology. Individuals within the society may not always agree with governmental decisions because of differences in how they weigh the value of each cost and benefit.  For example, an environmentalist would most likely value preserving a forest more than a land developer would. Sometimes environmental quality has to be compared to economic growth and employment. In the United States, for example, many states have chosen to sacrifice air or water quality to ensure employment.
