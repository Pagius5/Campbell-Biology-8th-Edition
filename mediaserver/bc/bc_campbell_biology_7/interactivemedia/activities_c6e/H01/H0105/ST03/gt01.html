All organic molecules, such as <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('carbohydrates.html');return false;">carbohydrates</a>, fats, and proteins, contain the element carbon. Like all animals, you get carbon atoms from the organic molecules in the food that you eat, and ultimately this carbon comes from plants. Plants take in carbon dioxide gas from the air, and in photosynthesis they use the carbon atoms to build carbohydrates. So the carbon in the food that you eat was originally floating around in the air.
