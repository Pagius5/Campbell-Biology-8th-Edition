Rules:<br>The object of the game is to arrange the cards in order in a single stack with the highest level of biological organization on the bottom of the stack. <br>1. The computer will automatically shuffle and deal the cards.<br>2. Look at the three columns on the right. If you can, drag and drop cards onto each other so that a smaller level of biological organization is on top of the next larger level (e.g., "<a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('tissues.html');return false;">Tissues</a>" should be on top of "<a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('organ.html');return false;">Organ</a>"). Single cards or stacks of cards can be moved.<br>3. When an upside-down card is exposed, click on it to turn it face up.<br>4. Click on the deck on the left to flip cards over. If any card belongs on top of a card on the right, drag it over. When you reach the end of the deck, click the "Flip Deck" button to continue.<br>5. When an empty column becomes available on the right, any face-up card or stack of cards can be moved to that slot.<br>6. If you get stuck or just want to play again, click the "New Game" button.
