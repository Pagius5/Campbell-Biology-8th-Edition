<a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('lipids.html');return false;">Lipids</a> are a diverse family of molecules that includes fats, <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('phospholipids.html');return false;">phospholipids</a>, waxes, and <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('steroids.html');return false;">steroids</a> such as <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cholesterol.html');return false;">cholesterol</a>. One feature that all lipids share is their low solubility in water, a characteristic that is important to the functions of many lipids. Cells often contain droplets containing fats-- large lipid molecules rich in stored energy. Adipose cells in animals are almost completely filled with fat. In addition to storing energy, adipose tissue also insulates the body and cushions organs. The membranes around and within cells are made mostly of phospholipids. Cholesterol, a type of lipid called a steroid, is also a component of membranes.
