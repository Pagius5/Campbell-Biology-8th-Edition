Most biological molecules are very large and are built by assembling small molecules, or <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('monomers.html');return false;">monomers</a>, into long chains. The resulting molecules are called <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('macromolecules.html');return false;">macromolecules</a>, or <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('polymers.html');return false;">polymers</a>. A process of linking monomers, called <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('dehydrationsynthesis.html');return false;">dehydration synthesis</a>, involves the removal of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom to form water. One way this might happen is diagrammed here, where several generic monomers are shown with -OH groups that could be used for linking. The animation illustrates the joining together of monomers by dehydration synthesis (catalyzed by a polymerase enzyme), and the reverse process, in which added water results in <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('hydrolysis.html');return false;">hydrolysis</a> (catalyzed by a hydrolase enzyme).
