Sometimes organisms link sugar molecules in pairs to form <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('disaccharides.html');return false;">disaccharides</a>. Here are several examples:<br><br>-- Plants make sucrose by joining glucose and fructose. Sucrose circulates in plant sap, and we obtain it from sugar cane and sugar beets and use it as table sugar.<br><br>-- Lactose is formed by joining galactose and glucose. Lactose is the disaccharide that gives milk its sweet taste.<br><br>-- Maltose consists of two linked glucose molecules. Digestion of starch-- in a sprouting seed or in the intestine of an animal-- produces this disaccharide.
