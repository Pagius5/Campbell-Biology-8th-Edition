(The video is visual only, without narration.)<br><br>These large tube-dwelling worms were filmed at the Galapagos Rift in the Pacific Ocean. Some may reach more than one meter in length. Worms like these were first seen in the late 1970s, when scientists discovered an unusual assemblage of animals living on the bottom in the vicinity of hydrothermal vents. About a dozen prokaryotic species are found here that are chemoautotrophs -- capable of carrying out synthesis of organic compounds using energy derived from chemical oxidation of hydrogen sulfide, rather than light. The massive amount of hydrogen sulfide formed at these regions allows these chemoautotrophic bacteria to serve as the basis for an incredibly diverse community of unusual animals, including the worms shown here. Many of these animals contain the bacteria inside themselves as symbionts that provide organic compounds as nourishment for their hosts. The vestimentiferan worms shown here were so unusual in structure that they were determined not to belong to any known phylum, and were assigned their own novel phylum.
