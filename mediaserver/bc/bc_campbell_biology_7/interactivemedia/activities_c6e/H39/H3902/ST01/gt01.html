Many events in the life cycle of a flowering plant (seed germination and flowering, for example) occur at different times of year. The environmental stimulus that most often triggers seasonal changes is called photoperiod, the relative lengths of night and day. <p>Some plants are called short-day (long-night) plants. For short-day plants, the critical night length is the <U>minimum</U> number of hours of darkness required for flowering. For long-day plants, the critical night length is the <U>maximum</U> number of hours of darkness required for flowering. Day-neutral plants flower when they mature, regardless of photoperiod.<p>Click the button to enter the flowering lab.
