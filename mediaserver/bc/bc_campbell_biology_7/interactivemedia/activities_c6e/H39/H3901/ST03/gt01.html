Why do leaves change color before they fall? During the autumn months, when temperatures begin to decrease and daylight diminishes, the abscission layer begins to form, slowly cutting off the transport of water and sugars between leaf and stem, and signaling the end of sugar production in the blades. At the same time, chlorophyll breaks down and the intense green color of the blade begins to fade. With the fading of the chlorophyll, we begin to see the yellow and orange hues of the carotenoids, pigments that were present all along in the chloroplasts.<br><br>Simultaneously, if the abscission layer forms before all the chlorophyll has broken down and while the days are still sunny and warm, sugars may be trapped in the vacuole of each palisade cell. If sugars are trapped and prevented from moving away from the blade to the stem, their relative concentration within each cell increases and triggers the production of deep purple or scarlet red anthocyanin pigments.<br><br>The combination of yellow, orange, red and purple within dying leaves provides spectacular fall color in some parts of the world. Sometimes we see colorful patterns in a single leaf, as in this ornamental pear. Identify each pigment by selecting the correct term from the pull-down menu.
