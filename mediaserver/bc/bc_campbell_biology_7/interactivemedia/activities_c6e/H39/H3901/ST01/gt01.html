Why do trees lose their leaves? In certain parts of our world, known as temperate zones, trees must have some sort of protection to survive the freezing temperatures and cold, drying winds of winter. Stems and buds have coatings and structures that allow them to withstand harsh conditions. Broad flat leaves are quite delicate and would freeze in the winter, so trees either lose the leaves all at once, or they produce small, narrow, flattened leaves with extra protection to survive the winter.
