Leaf abscission, the loss of leaves in deciduous trees, is preceded by events that protect sites where leaves were once attached. Where the petiole joins the stem, an abscission layer forms, consisting of weak, colorless, thin-walled cells that allow the leaf to separate easily when a gust of wind comes along. Meanwhile, a protective layer of densely colored cells has formed between the abscission layer and the stem.  These protective cells are filled with waxy material that forms a thick seal over the place where the leaf will become detached. New growth will come from the axillary bud that has already formed in the angle between the leaf and the stem. Think of losing a leaf as scraping your skin, only to find a protective "scab" already in place.<br><br>Click on the leaf to see abscission.
