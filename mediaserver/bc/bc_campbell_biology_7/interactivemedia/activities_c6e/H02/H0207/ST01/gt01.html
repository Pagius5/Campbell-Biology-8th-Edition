Sometimes atoms complete their outer shells by stealing or giving away electrons. This happens between sodium and chlorine atoms. An electron moves from the sodium atom to the chlorine atom. The outer shells of both atoms are now complete-- containing 8 electrons. The chlorine atom now has 18 electrons but only 17 protons. Because an electron has a negative charge, the chlorine atom now has a net negative charge. Such a charged atom (or molecule) is called an <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('ion.html');return false;">ion</a>-- in this case, a negative ion. The sodium atom has lost an electron, leaving it with an extra proton, which has a positive charge. The sodium atom has become a positive ion.<br><br>Ions with opposite charges are attracted to each other, forming an <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('ionicbond.html');return false;">ionic bond</a>. These ions combine to form a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('compound.html');return false;">compound</a> with new properties. In this case, sodium chloride-- ordinary table salt-- is formed.
