This activity will allow you to test your understanding of atomic structure by building atoms out of their subatomic particles. Click on an element in the periodic table to choose the atom you want to build. The mass number and atomic number of the atom you have chosen will appear in the boxes at the upper left.<p>Drag the correct number of subatomic particles&mdash; protons, neutrons, and electrons&mdash; to build the atom from the supply in the beakers. The totals of each are tallied under the mass number and atomic number. When you think you have dragged the correct numbers of particles to their proper locations, click "Check Answer" to see if you're right. Click "Reset" to start over. Click "Show Answer" if you want to see the correct responses for the atom you chose.
