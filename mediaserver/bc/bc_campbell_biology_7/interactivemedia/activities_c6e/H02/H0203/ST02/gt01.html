The chemical properties of an atom depend mostly on the number of electrons in its outermost electron shell. An atom is most stable when it has a full outermost shell-- two electrons for small atoms such as hydrogen, and eight electrons for larger atoms such as carbon or chlorine. By transferring or sharing electrons, atoms complete their outer shells. These interactions between atoms create chemical bonds.
