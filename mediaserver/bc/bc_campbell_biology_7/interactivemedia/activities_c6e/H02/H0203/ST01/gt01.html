A cloud of negatively-charged electrons surrounds the nucleus. In an uncharged atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons. Electrons occupy specific energy levels, called electron shells, shown here as concentric circles. The innermost shell can hold up to two electrons; the next few shells can hold up to eight electrons apiece.
