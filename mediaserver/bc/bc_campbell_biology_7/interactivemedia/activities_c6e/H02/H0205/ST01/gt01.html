A <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('covalentbond.html');return false;">covalent bond</a> is the sharing of a pair of outer-shell electrons by two atoms. For example, each of these hydrogen atoms has one electron in its outer shell, but needs two electrons to complete its outer shell. If the two hydrogen atoms share electrons, they can both complete their outer shells. The shared pair of electrons constitutes a covalent bond-- shown in shorthand as a line. The covalently-bonded hydrogen atoms form a <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('molecule.html');return false;">molecule</a> of hydrogen gas. A molecule is defined as two or more atoms held together by covalent bonds.
