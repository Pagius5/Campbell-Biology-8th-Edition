Correct. Each <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('pollen.html');return false;">pollen</a> grain contains cells that can develop into sperm. Since pollen grains are small and resistant to drying, they can be carried by wind or animals to female parts of plants some distance away. Development of pollen that could travel through dry air from one plant to another was critically important to the evolution of plants on land. Plants such as pine trees and flowering plants have pollen.
