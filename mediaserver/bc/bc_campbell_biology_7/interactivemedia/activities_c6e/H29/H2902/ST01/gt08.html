No. <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('stomata.html');return false;">Stomata</a> are microscopic pores in a leafís surface that allow carbon dioxide and oxygen to be exchanged between the atmosphere and the interior of the leaf. The carbon dioxide that algae need for <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('photosynthesis.html');return false;">photosynthesis</a> is dissolved in the water that supports and suspends them. Carbon dioxide and oxygen are able to move freely into and out of the cells of algae. Thus, algae have no need for stomata.
