Sorry. The <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('seed.html');return false;">seed</a> with a protected embryo is an adaptation which allows the embryo to survive during periods of drought and to rapidly grow roots and shoots using nutrients stored in the seed. Since algae are constantly surrounded by water and nutrients, they have no need to protect their embryos from drought or to store large amounts of nutrients.
