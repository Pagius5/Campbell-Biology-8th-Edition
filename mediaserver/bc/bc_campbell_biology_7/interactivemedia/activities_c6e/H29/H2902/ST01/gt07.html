That is correct. The outermost cells of a plant are covered with a waxy material called the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cuticle.html');return false;">cuticle</a>, which covers all the leaves, stems, and, to a lesser degree, the roots. The cuticle is largely responsible for preventing the movement of water molecules from inside the plant to the much drier atmosphere outside the plant. The effectiveness of the cuticle is manifest in cacti growing in the desert. Cacti can endure a month of daytime temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit without losing appreciable amounts of water.
