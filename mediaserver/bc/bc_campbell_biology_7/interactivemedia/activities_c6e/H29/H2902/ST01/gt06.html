Sorry. A waxy <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cuticle.html');return false;">cuticle</a> is an adaptation that limits the movement of water between the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cytoplasm.html');return false;">cytoplasm</a> of cells and the external environment. <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('algae.html');return false;">Algae</a> are fully aquatic organisms, living surrounded by water throughout their life cycle. Thus, algae have no need to limit water loss and they have no need for a waxy cuticle. When algae are exposed to dry air, they quickly dry out and die because they have no ability to limit water loss.
