Correct. <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('lignin.html');return false;">Lignin</a> is a chemical that hardens <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cellwalls.html');return false;">cell walls</a>, thus strengthening them. The stems, leaves, and flowers of terrestrial plants must all be held up in defiance of gravity. Holding stems, leaves, and flowers suspended in the air requires specially strengthened cell walls throughout the plant, particularly in the stems and roots. Without their especially strengthened cell walls, plants would be puddles of protoplasm hugging the surface of the ground. Clearly, lignin in cell walls was a critical adaptation for plant colonization of dry land.
