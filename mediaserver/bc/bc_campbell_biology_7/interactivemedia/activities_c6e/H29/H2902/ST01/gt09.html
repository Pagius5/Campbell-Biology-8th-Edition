You're right. Terrestrial plants face a difficult dilemma that is partially solved by having <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('stomata.html');return false;">stomata</a>. Terrestrial plants are covered with a waxy <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('cuticle.html');return false;">cuticle</a> that helps prevent the evaporation of water into the surrounding air. Unfortunately, the waxy cuticle also prevents carbon dioxide from entering the plant. The plant solution to this problem is to have openings called stomata. When the plant needs carbon dioxide for <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('photosynthesis.html');return false;">photosynthesis</a>, the stomata are opened to allow carbon dioxide to enter the interior of the leaf. Oxygen produced by photosynthesis can also leave the leaf through the stomata. However, the open stomata also allow water to leave the leaf, leading to potential desiccation. So, the stomata can be closed, preventing further water loss. Thus, the evolution of stomata helped plants obtain carbon dioxide while conserving water, an important milestone on the march from an aquatic environment to a fully terrestrial life.
