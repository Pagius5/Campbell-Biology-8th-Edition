That's not correct. <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('pollen.html');return false;">Pollen</a> grains, which are adapted to resist dry conditions in the atmosphere, contain cells that can develop into sperm. Since pollen grains are small, they can be carried by wind or animals to female parts of plants some distance away. Since algae are fully aquatic organisms, they have no need of special mechanisms to disperse their sperm or protect them from drying out. Rather, algae release mobile sperm directly into the surrounding water during sexual reproduction.
