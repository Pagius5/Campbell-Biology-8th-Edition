Sorry. <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('mycorrhizae.html');return false;">Mycorrhizae</a> are combinations of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('fungi.html');return false;">fungi</a> and plant roots. Water and minerals absorbed by the fungi are passed on to the plant. Since algae are fully aquatic, they do not experience the constant threat of desiccation and subsequent death that terrestrial plants must face. Thus, algae have not found it advantageous to enter into a symbiotic relationship with fungi based on the acquisition of additional water and minerals.
