That's correct. The water that is needed for terrestrial plant <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('photosynthesis.html');return false;">photosynthesis</a> and for life itself is primarily available in the soil. But the soil is dark and photosynthesis is impossible there. Aerial <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('shoots.html');return false;">shoots</a> with leaves maximize the exposure of vascular plants to the energy available in sunlight. Carbon dioxide is also available in the air. <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('roots.html');return false;">Roots</a> obtain water and mineral nutrients from the soil. With roots and shoots, terrestrial plants are able to obtain all of the resources they need to produce sugars by photosynthesis.
