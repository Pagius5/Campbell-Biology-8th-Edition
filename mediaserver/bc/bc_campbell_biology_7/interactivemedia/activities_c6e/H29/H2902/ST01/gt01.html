The vast majority of plants are vascular plants that bear seeds. The most common seed plants are flowering plants. This activity is intended to help you appreciate the adaptations that allowed plants, particularly seed plants, to successfully colonize land. The diagram shows an <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('alga.html');return false;">alga</a> and a flowering plant. The icons represent the major terrestrial adaptations of seed plants, as well as a few characteristics that are common to both algae and seed plants. Drag each icon to the algae, the plant, or both, as appropriate.
