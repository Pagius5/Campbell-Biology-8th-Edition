Correct. The source of water for most terrestrial plants is in the soil. But the photosynthetic tissues that need the water are located elsewhere in the plant away from the source of the water. Further, the photosynthetic tissues are exposed to the air, which is usually very dry. Terrestrial plants need an efficient way to move water from the soil upward to the aerial parts of the plant. The <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('vasculartissue.html');return false;">vascular tissue</a> transports water and minerals from the soil up to the leaves. It also distributes sugars from the leaves to the roots, which are nonphotosynthetic. The evolution of vascular tissue allowed the vascular terrestrial plants (such as ferns, pine trees, and flowering plants) to grow much larger than the nonvascular plants (such as the mosses).
