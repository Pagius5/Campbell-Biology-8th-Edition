Sugar produced by the leaves is pumped into the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('sievetubemembers.html');return false;">sieve-tube members</a> of the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('phloem.html');return false;">phloem</a> by <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('activetransport.html');return false;">active transport</a>. This raises the concentration of sugar, causing water to move into the phloem by <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('osmosis.html');return false;">osmosis</a>. Water pressure at the sugar source increases, pushing water and sugar away from the sugar source and toward the sugar sink&mdash; a process called bulk flow. At the sugar sink, root cells remove sugar by active transport and convert the sugar into starch. Again water follows by osmosis. This lowers the water pressure at the sink. Thus, the phloem transports water and its sugar cargo from the sugar source (in the leaves), where there is a buildup of pressure, to the sugar sink (in the root), where the pressure is lower.
