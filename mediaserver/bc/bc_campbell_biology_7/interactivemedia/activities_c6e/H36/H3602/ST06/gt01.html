In the spring, the direction is reversed, but the mechanism responsible for the translocation of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('phloem.html');return false;">phloem</a> sap is the same. Sugar in the taproot is actively transported into the phloem. Water flows into the phloem by <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('osmosis.html');return false;">osmosis</a>, increasing the water pressure. In the leaves, sugar is actively transported out of the phloem and water follows. Pressure flow drives water and sugar away from the sugar source and toward the sugar sink.
