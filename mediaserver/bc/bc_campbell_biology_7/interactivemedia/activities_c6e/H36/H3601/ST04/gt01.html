How do water and minerals get to the leaves? Although roots can exert a slight upward pressure, it is evaporation of water from leaves, a process called <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('transpiration.html');return false;">transpiration</a>, that moves water molecules and ions up from the roots. Transpiration exerts a pull that is relayed downward along a string of water molecules from leaf to root.
