All water and ions eventually have to pass through cell membranes and this is how the plant controls their uptake. Even water and ions that are traveling by the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('apoplastic.html');return false;">apoplastic</a> route must eventually pass through cells, because of a waxy waterproof band called the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('casparianstrip.html');return false;">Casparian strip</a>. This forces all water and solutes to pass through the plasma membranes of <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('endodermis.html');return false;">endodermis</a> cells, and thus these cells are able to exert ultimate control over the kinds and amounts of substances that enter the plant. Once the selected solutes and water are in the endodermis cells, they can be discharged into the <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHotTextDef('xylem.html');return false;">xylem</a> for transport to the rest of the plant.
