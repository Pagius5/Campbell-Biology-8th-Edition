The process of generating a state of immunity by artifical means. In active immunization, a nonpathogenic version of a normally pathogenic microbe is administered, inducing B and T cell responses and immunological memory. In passive immunization, antibodies specific for a particular microbe are administered, conferring immediate but temporary protection. Also called vaccination.
