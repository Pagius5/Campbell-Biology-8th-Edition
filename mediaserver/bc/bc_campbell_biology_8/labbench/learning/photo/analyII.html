		<P>
		Following the procedures described above, expose the tubes to light and make an initial spectrophotometer reading, followed by readings at 5, 10, and 15 minutes. 
		<P>
		Print the graphs below and, based on your understanding of the light reactions of photosynthesis, draw in the approximate shapes of the curves you predict. Bring the graphs to class with you.

		<! -- PPI: The following text is for Instructor's manual only, along with completed graphs:
		Tube 2: The amount of light transmitted  should increase as DPIP is reduced and goes from blue to colorless.
		Tube 3:  The amount of light transmitted should vary little during the experiment because the tube is kept in the dark, and DPIP is not being reduced.  If there is a slight increase in transmittance, it may be due to the short amount of time the tube is in the light during the experiment.
		Tube 4:  The amount of light transmitted should not vary during the experiment because boiling denatures proteins and the chlorophyll molecules no longer function. 
		There are now 3 blank graphs not four, and include image predres.gif-->
