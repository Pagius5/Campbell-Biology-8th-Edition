		Correct!  The rate of the reaction drops when the enzyme no longer has a maximum number of substrate molecules to interact with.  Above the maximum substrate concentration, the rate will not be increased by adding more substrate; the enzyme is already working as fast as it can.  An enzyme can catalyze a certain number of reactions per second, and if there is not sufficient substrate present for it to work at its maximum velocity, the rate will decrease.  Therefore, to <I>keep</I> the enzyme working at its maximum, you must add more substrate.
