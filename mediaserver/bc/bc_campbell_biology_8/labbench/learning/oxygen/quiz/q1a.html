		Sorry.  The correct answer is d.  Turbulence such as that seen in a rapidly moving stream aerates the water, so that there would be more oxygen than in either a lake or a still lagoon.  Salt water and warm temperature decrease the ability of water to hold oxygen.  A mat of aquatic plants blocks light to lower portions of the water, and the high rate of decomposition of organic matter consumes much oxygen.
