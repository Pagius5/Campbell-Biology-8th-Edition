		<P>

		After the pillbugs have been in the choice chamber for 10 minutes, you might observe one of these situations:

		Pillbugs are crustaceans, and they respire through gills.  Because of this characteristic, which situation would you predict to occur &#151; A, B, or C?

		<P>

		Based on the previous information, and knowledge that pillbugs are found in moist environments, most people would predict situation B.  This is often what occurs, but not always!  Situations A and C are also common.  

		<P>

		This brings us to an important consideration:  The pillbug exercise is not a controlled experiment.  Could there be more light at one end of the choice chamber?  More activity and vibration?  A chemical residue on one side?  Any of these conditions and more could possibly influence the organism's behavior. Without a control, it is very risky to state a conclusion.  

		<P>

		In the second part of the Animal Behavior lab, you design a controlled experiment.
