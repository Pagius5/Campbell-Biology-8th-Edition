		Sorry.  The correct response is d.  There are two nuclear divisions in meiosis, and only one in mitosis.  Crossing over occurs only in meiosis; it does not occur at all in mitosis.  Replication occurs only once in preparation for both mitosis and meiosis.  The daughter cells of mitosis are identical to the parent cell, but in meiosis the daughter cells have only one of each homologous chromosome pair.  Synapsis occurs only in prophase I of meiosis.
